## 🕯️ CUSTODIAN’S ALMANAC (GM GUIDE)

### 8 Luck Tests — Guidance
Call for Luck when **no skill reasonably applies** or when sheer fate decides: rockfalls, blind picks, surprise patrol timings. Use sparingly: one or two per session is plenty.

### 9 Pressure Track (Doom / Shadow / Anomaly)
A 0–5 fuse shared by all skins.

| Step | Mood | GM levers |
|--|--|--|
|0|Calm|—|
|1|Unease|Cosmetic omens|
|2|Stirrings|Minor Disadvantage, flicker tech|
|3|Rumble|Noticeable penalty, NPC mistrust|
|4|Fracture|Abilities cost +1 Luck, environment hostile|
|5 **Crisis**|Backlash / Paradox|Trigger Crisis table, reset to 0|

**Earning & Purging** — failure on risky rituals, taboo acts, or desperate bargains adds +1.  Sacrifice, cleansing rites, or story quests remove points.  Crisis results in a dramatic twist then resets.

### 10 Milestones & Boons
Every 3–4 perilous beats, award 2 build points **and** a narrative boon (rare item, ally favour, mystic scar). Boons never break the maths; they sit outside the economy.

### 11 GM Moves When Players Stall
Advance clock · reveal omen · shift terrain · offer harsh bargain. Keep fiction flowing without forcing dice every time.

### 12 Optional Plug‑Ins
* **Totem/Feat** — once per session gain Advantage at cost of 1 Luck or +1 Pressure.  
* **Allies / Pets** — treat as a temporary 3‑token Luck pool that depletes on use.  
* **Stress Tracks** — Fear, Radiation, Madness: same 0–5 ladder, own colour text.
