## 🕯️ CUSTODIAN’S ALMANAC (GM GUIDE)

### 1 Luck Tests — Guidance

Call for Luck when **no skill reasonably applies** or when sheer fate decides: rockfalls, blind picks, surprise patrol timings. Use sparingly: one or two per session is plenty.

You can season luck recovery: a sacred ritual adds +3, a night on Martian rad‑dust adds none.

### 2 Pressure Track (Doom / Shadow / Anomaly)

A 0–5 fuse shared by all skins.

| Step         | Mood               | GM levers                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | Calm               | —                                           |
| 1            | Unease             | Cosmetic omens                              |
| 2            | Stirrings          | Minor Disadvantage, flicker tech            |
| 3            | Rumble             | Noticeable penalty, NPC mistrust            |
| 4            | Fracture           | Abilities cost +1 Luck, environment hostile |
| 5 **Crisis** | Backlash / Paradox | Trigger Crisis table, reset to 0            |

**Earning & Purging** — failure on risky rituals, taboo acts, or desperate bargains adds +1.  Sacrifice, cleansing rites, or story quests remove points.  Crisis results in a dramatic twist then resets.

### 3 Milestones & Boons

Every 3–4 perilous beats, award 2 build points **and** a narrative boon (rare item, ally favour, mystic scar). Boons never break the maths; they sit outside the economy. 

Progress is narrative, not numeric grind.

### 4 GM Moves When Players Stall

Advance clock · reveal omen · shift terrain · offer harsh bargain. Keep fiction flowing without forcing dice every time.

### 5 Optional Plug‑Ins

- **Totem/Feat** — once per session gain Advantage at cost of 1 Luck or +1 Pressure.
- **Allies / Pets** — treat as a temporary 3‑token Luck pool that depletes on use.
- **Stress Tracks** — Fear, Radiation, Madness: same 0–5 ladder, own colour text.

### 6 Advice for the AI GM

In AI-driven play:

- Write scenes of 200–500 words: *Hook → Action → Consequence* ending on tension.&#x20;
- Offer 2–4 numbered options, one risky or hidden.&#x20;
- Track scenes as a directed graph; mark *Save Nodes* for rewinds on total defeat at a cost (Pool drain or +Pressure).
- Keep dice secret for suspense or show them for agency—your call. Use hidden code (\`random.randint(1,20)\`) to preserve neutrality; surface results, margins, and Pool‑spend offers.

*Print this on a single sheet, slide it under a coffee cup, and you’re ready to run anything from mammoth hunts to star‑ship mutinies.*
