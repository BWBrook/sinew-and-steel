## 🕯️ CUSTODIAN’S ALMANAC (GM Guide)

### 1 Luck Tests — Guidance

Call for Luck when **no skill reasonably applies** or when sheer fate decides: rockfalls, blind picks, surprise patrol timings. Use sparingly: one or two per session is plenty.

You can season luck recovery: a sacred ritual adds +3, a night on Martian rad‑dust adds none.

### 2 Pressure Track (Doom / Shadow / Anomaly, etc.)

A 0–5 fuse shared by all skins.

| Step         | Mood               | GM levers                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | Calm               | —                                           |
| 1            | Unease             | Cosmetic omens                              |
| 2            | Stirrings          | Minor Disadvantage, flicker tech            |
| 3            | Rumble             | Noticeable penalty, NPC mistrust            |
| 4            | Fracture           | Abilities cost +1 Luck, environment hostile |
| 5 **Crisis** | Backlash / Paradox | Trigger Crisis table, reset to 0            |

**Earning & Purging** — failure on risky rituals, taboo acts, or desperate bargains adds +1.  Sacrifice, cleansing rites, or story quests remove points.  Crisis results in a dramatic twist then resets.

### 3 Milestones & Boons

Every 3–4 perilous beats, award 2 build points **and** a narrative boon (rare item, ally favour, mystic scar). Boons never break the maths; they sit outside the economy. 

Progress is narrative, not numeric grind.

### 4 GM Moves When Players Stall

Advance clock · reveal omen · shift terrain · offer harsh bargain. Keep fiction flowing without forcing dice every time.

### 5 Optional Plug‑Ins

- **Totem/Feat** — once per session gain Advantage at cost of 1 Luck or +1 Pressure.
- **Allies / Pets** — treat as a temporary 3‑token Luck pool that depletes on use.
- **Stress Tracks** — Fear, Radiation, Madness: same 0–5 ladder, own colour text.

### 6 Advice for the AI GM

In AI-driven play:

- Write scenes of 300–500 words: *Hook → Action → Consequence* ending on tension.
- Offer 2–4 numbered options, one risky or hidden.
- Track scenes as a directed graph; mark *Save Nodes* for rewinds on total defeat at a cost (Pool drain or +Pressure).
- Keep dice secret for suspense or show them for agency—your call. Use hidden code (\`random.randint(1,20)\`) to preserve neutrality; surface results, margins, and Pool‑spend offers.

**Beat length guideline:** Descriptive passage should fall between 300 and 500 words (2-5 paragraphs) before options. Include at least two vivid sensory cues and a note of inner mood. If rushed play demands shorter text, bank that “word credit” and pay it back next beat.

## Part I Player Insights

### A. Why Five Numbers?

Five scores map cleanly onto the d20’s 20‑step granularity while keeping sheets readable. A ±2 trade‑off rule stops power creep yet lets extremes emerge.

### B. Burning Luck — When It Matters

- **Save the day**: Flip a total miss into a glancing hit to avoid a TPK.
- **Pierce armour**: Spend extra tokens after a success to deepen margin and shred soak.
- **Turn the plot**: Burn the last 3 Luck on a vital opposed test—knowing future Luck rolls are now long shots.

> **Guideline**: A pool under 4 tokens means “walk gingerly”; under 2 means “pray for milestone.”

### C. Sample Builds (baseline 10/5)

| Concept       | MGT    | REF | INT    | EMP    | LCK | STA   |
| ------------- | ------ | --- | ------ | ------ | --- | ----- |
| Scholar       | 7      | 10  | **14** | 10     | 7   | 3     |
| Iron Brute    | **15** | 7   | 6      | 6      | 8   | **8** |
| Silver‑tongue | 8      | 8   | **11** | **12** | 9   | 4     |

All obey the +1/‑2 ledger.

## Part II Optional Plug-in Rules

### A. Tone Dial — Build-Point Pool
At character creation you may gift each player additional build points: 0 for grim survival, 8 for pulpy competence, 16 for heroic flair, or whatever suits your campaign.

The pool lets heroes spike a signature strength or patch a weakness without repainting every stat. It adjusts the success rate (≈ 50 %, 60 %, 70 %) while leaving all core maths, tables and advance pacing untouched.

### B. Luck Test Frequency

> **Rule of Thumb**: If you’ve called for Luck twice this session, reach for another lever before a third.

### C. Pressure Colour Suggestions

| Skin            | 1                | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5 (Crisis)        |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Sword & Sorcery | Whispered sigils | Blood moon    | Spirits stalk | Gates crack   | Demon walks       |
| Hard‑SF         | Static blips     | Sensor ghosts | Hull groans   | Reactor spike | Core breach       |
| Gothic Horror   | Chill wind       | Mirrors fog   | Whispers grow | Shadows move  | The Guest arrives |

### D. NPC / Monster Design (30‑second method)

1. **Pick Threat Tier**
   *Peasant 8 | Soldier 10 | Elite 12 | Monster 14 | Nemesis 16*
2. **Assign Edge & Soak**
   Light 0 / Standard +1 edge | Hide 1 soak / Shell 2 soak.
3. **Give a Hook**
   “Claw swipe +1 dmg,” “Mind‑spike forces Luck roll,” etc.

*Example*: **Morlock Brute** – MGT 12, REF 8, edge +1 club, soak 1 hide, special: on hit may drag victim 5 m into darkness.
*Example*: **Cave Bear** – MGT 15, FLT 8, edge +2 maul, soak 1 thick fur, special: on attacker Nat 1 bear counter‑swipes 1 STM.

### E. “Fatal Tag” — a one-line universal override  

> **Fatal** This harm **ignores Stamina and soak**; a struck target drops to 0 STM unless they possess the one listed counter-measure.

*Use it sparingly, flag it clearly, and state the counter up front.*

| Setting | Fatal weapon / event | Counter-measure |
|---|---|---|
| **Jeffries-Tube Blues** | Phaser set to *disrupt* | Personal shield emitter or starship force-field |
| **Age Undreamed Of** | Basilisk gaze | Averting eyes behind a polished bronze mirror |
| **Clanfire** | Mammoth stampede hoof | Spending 1 Instinct **and** passing a FLT roll to dive clear |
| **Candlelight Dungeons** | Assassin’s throat-slit on sleeping victim | Staying conscious or wearing gorget; helmet while resting |

**How to apply**

1. Declare the attack/event is **Fatal (counter: X)**.  
2. If the target lacks the counter, they drop to **0 Stamina** immediately; normal collapse/death rules follow.  
3. Counters can be equipment, a successful roll, or a resource spend—keep it explicit.

**Why it works**

* Adds cinematic stakes without new math.  
* Remains lean: a single tag plus a counter clause.  
* Scales across genres—laser vaporise, divine smite, syringe to carotid—without rewriting core combat.

### F. Advantage Source List

- Solid cover   (Dodge Adv.)
- Height on foe (Melee Adv.)
- Blind firing  (Ranged Dis.)
- Exhausted     (Stamina ≤ 2 ⇒ Dis. on physical)

Add or prune per setting.

### G. Milestone Boon Bank (d6)

1. Trusted ally owes a favour
2. Rare gadget (+1 Adv. on one skill)
3. Mystic scar (+1 build point to Spirit stat)
4. Hidden refuge grants full Luck reset mid‑adventure
5. Weapon gains +1 edge vs. one foe type
6. Vision of future – ask GM one yes/no about next session

### H. Conversion Pointers

- **d100 games** – divide skill by 5 ≈ attribute
- **PBTA 2d6+stat** – (10+ stat) × 5 ≈ attribute chance
- **OSR AC** – treat armour class /2 rounded as soak (leather 1… plate 3)
