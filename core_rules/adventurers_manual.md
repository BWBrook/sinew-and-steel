## ðŸ“œÂ ADVENTURER'S MANUAL (Player's Handbook)

### 1â€‚Core Principle

Roll **one d20**. If the result is **â‰¤ your attribute**, you succeed; higher, you fail.

- **Naturalâ€¯1**Â â€“ legendary successâ€ƒ|â€ƒ**Naturalâ€¯20**Â â€“ disastrous failure
- **Advantage / Disadvantage**Â â€“ roll two d20, keep the lower / higher.
- **Opposed rolls**Â â€“ both parties roll; if both succeed compare **margins** (attributeÂ âˆ’Â roll). Higher margin wins; **ties favour the defender**.
- Roll only when uncertainty + real stakes = drama.

### 2â€‚Building a Hero

Start with the **baseline frame**:

- Five attributes at **10** (rename to taste: Might, Reflex, Intellect, Empathy, Luckâ€¦)
- **Staminaâ€¯5**

**Pointâ€‘Buy Rule (doubleâ€‘debit)**\
Every +1 you add **above baseline** costs **â€‘2** total subtracted from any other score(s).
No score may drop belowâ€¯6 or rise aboveâ€¯16 (Stamina floors atâ€¯3, caps atâ€¯9).

> *"Bump a stat up? Pay double elsewhere."*

Milestones hand out **2 build points** that follow the same rule: +1 to an aboveâ€‘baseline stat **or** +2 to a belowâ€‘baseline stat.

---

### 3â€‚Luck Pool

Your **Luck score** *is* your token count.

> "*The more you bend fate, the greater the later risk.*"

- Spend any number of tokens after seeing a roll to nudge the die Â±1 per token (naturalsÂ 1Â &Â 20 remain fixed).
- Luck tests roll â‰¤ *current* score.
- Rest +1 token; Milestone refills to baseline (and may raise that for 2 build points).

> *You may spend Luck after a successful attack to deepen your margin and chew through armour (see 6.2).*

---

### 4â€‚Health & Recovery

- Generic woundÂ =â€¯1.
- Light / Standard / Brutal weapons add +0Â /Â +1Â /Â +2.
- At **0â€¯STM** you collapse; fate per fiction.
- Short rest +1â€¯STM; good care +2.
- Healing caps at baseline STM.

### 5â€‚Taking Action

#### 5.1â€‚Simple Tests

Roll under the relevant attribute. Advantage / Disadvantage as fiction dictates.

#### 5.2â€‚Opposed Tests

Both roll. If only one succeeds, that side wins. If both succeed, compare margins; higher wins, ties defend.

---

### 6â€‚Combat Snapshot

1. **Attacker** rolls under Melee/Range attribute.
2. **Defender** rolls under Dodge/Parry/Cover.
3. On a hit: damageÂ =Â 1â€¯STMÂ +Â weapon edge â€“ **effective soak**.
4. Naturalâ€¯1 or marginâ€¯â‰¥â€¯10 adds +1 damage.

#### 6.1â€‚Weapon Edges (suggested)

- Improvised club 0â€ƒ|â€ƒBlade/Spear/HandgunÂ +1â€ƒ|â€ƒGreatâ€‘axe/Rifle/PlasmaÂ +2

#### 6.2â€‚Armour & Dynamic Soak

| Armour                   | Base soak |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| Hide / Leather           | 1         |
| Mail / Kevlar            | 2         |
| Plate / Powered carapace | 3         |

After a hit reduce soak **byâ€¯1 for every full 4 points of attacker margin** (round down). Remainder subtracts from damage. Criticalâ€¯1 ignores all soak.

### 7 Carry Limit

Six substantial items ride comfortably; more invites Disadvantage on agility tasks. Tiny trinkets are free. Money has no limit, but excess attracts unwanted attention.
