**SINEW & STEEL — UNIVERSAL ROLL‑UNDER ENGINE**
*A lean system for narrative‑first roleplay, ready to wear any setting‑skin. Also ideal for use with reasoning AI game masters.*

---

### 1. CORE PRINCIPLE
One die, one target: roll a **single d20**. If the result is **≤ attribute**, you succeed; higher, you fail. Everything else is flavour on that spine.

• **Natural 1** — extraordinary success.  
• **Natural 20** — catastrophic mishap.  
• **Advantage / Disadvantage** — roll two d20, keep lower / higher.  
• **Opposed Tests** — both sides roll; if both succeed compare **margin** (attribute − roll). Bigger margin wins, ties go to the defender.

Why roll? Only when outcome uncertainty meets meaningful stakes.

---

### 2. ATTRIBUTES
Choose **five** sliders; label to taste (Might, Reflex, Insight, etc.). Start at **10** each. To personalise: drop one attribute **‑2** to raise another **+1** (repeat as desired). Range **6–16** keeps odds sensible.

Think of each hero as starting with a flat, balanced body:

  • Five attributes sit at 10.  
  • Stamina sits at 5.  

That’s your *baseline frame*. Now the sculpting rule is brutally simple:

> **Every time you push one score one step *above* its baseline, you must carve two points away from the other scores.**

Because each point *below* baseline is worth half a point *above*, the ledger always balances.

A cleaner way to phrase it without math‑gremlins:

1. Begin with STR, REF, INT, EMP, LCK all at 10; STA at 5.  
2. Decide what you want to raise. For every +1 you take, reduce any combination of the other five numbers by a total of 2.  
3. No score may initially fall below 6 or climb above 16; Stamina stays between 3 and 9.

Examples sharpen the edge:

*You want a razor‑witted but fragile scholar.*  
Raise INT from 10 → 14 (+4). That costs 8 points elsewhere. Drop STR 10→7 (‑3), LCK 10→7 (‑3), STA 5→4 (‑1), and REF 10→9 (‑1). Margins check: no stat breaches the 6‑16 rails.

*You fancy a brute with iron lungs.*  
Lift STR 10→16 (+6) and STA 5→8 (+3). Total cost +9. Shave nine points off the rest—say REF 10→7 (‑3), INT 10→6 (‑4), LCK 10→8 (‑2). Again the books close.

However you juggle the numbers, the underlying economic law never bends: +1 above baseline is paid for by –2 somewhere else. That keeps attribute inflation in check while still letting you build extremes.

If you ever need to explain it at the table in a breath: “Bump a stat up? Pay double out of the others.”

**Character Experience**
Milestones  hand the player a fresh pair of “build points” and the same accounting law applies:

* **Spend 2 points to nudge any one score that’s already *above* baseline up by +1.**
* **Or** spend those 2 points to haul any *below‑baseline* score up by +2—effectively buying it back toward the centre at the same exchange rate.

Nothing else changes: rail guards (6‑16 for attributes, Stamina 3‑9) still stand, and the Pressure/Pool tracks remain untouched unless a boon explicitly says otherwise.

Example:
• Your hardened scout sits at REF 14, INT 12, STR 9, EMP 8, LCK 7, STA 5.  
• Milestone earned → 2 build points.  
 – Option A: bump REF 14→15 (cost 2).  
 – Option B: lift LCK 7→9 (cost 2).  
 – Option C: nudge STR 9→10 (+1, cost 2) and bank nothing, because points must be spent in pairs.  
 – Option D: raise STA 5→6 (+1, cost 2).  
 – Option E: any boon that offers a flat +1 outside the economy is a *narrative* gift, not a mechanical purchase.

*Success Tables*
Below is the probability table for a single d20 roll‑under system. Percentages are the chances of rolling *equal to or below* the listed score (rounded).

| Score | Straight roll | With **Advantage** | With **Disadvantage** |
|-------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 6  | 30 % | 51 % | 9 % |
| 7  | 35 % | 58 % | 12 % |
| 8  | 40 % | 64 % | 16 % |
| 9  | 45 % | 70 % | 20 % |
| 10 | 50 % | 75 % | 25 % |
| 11 | 55 % | 80 % | 30 % |
| 12 | 60 % | 84 % | 36 % |
| 13 | 65 % | 88 % | 42 % |
| 14 | 70 % | 91 % | 49 % |
| 15 | 75 % | 94 % | 56 % |
| 16 | 80 % | 96 % | 64 % |

**Advantage** = roll two d20 and keep the lower result; **Disadvantage** = keep the higher. 


The below table shows the **Probability that the *attacker* wins an opposed check (rounded to the nearest whole %)**

| **Att\Def** | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |
|:-----------:|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **6**  | 25 | 23 | 22 | 20 | 19 | 17 | 16 | 14 | 13 | 11 | 10 |
| **7**  | 30 | 28 | 26 | 24 | 23 | 21 | 19 | 18 | 16 | 14 | 12 |
| **8**  | 35 | 33 | 31 | 29 | 27 | 25 | 23 | 21 | 19 | 17 | 15 |
| **9**  | 40 | 38 | 36 | 34 | 32 | 29 | 27 | 25 | 22 | 20 | 18 |
| **10** | 45 | 43 | 41 | 39 | 36 | 34 | 31 | 29 | 26 | 24 | 21 |
| **11** | 50 | 48 | 46 | 44 | 41 | 38 | 36 | 33 | 30 | 28 | 25 |
| **12** | 55 | 53 | 51 | 49 | 46 | 44 | 40 | 38 | 34 | 32 | 28 |
| **13** | 60 | 58 | 56 | 54 | 51 | 48 | 46 | 42 | 39 | 36 | 32 |
| **14** | 65 | 63 | 61 | 59 | 56 | 54 | 50 | 47 | 44 | 40 | 37 |
| **15** | 70 | 68 | 66 | 64 | 61 | 58 | 56 | 52 | 49 | 45 | 41 |
| **16** | 75 | 73 | 71 | 69 | 66 | 64 | 60 | 57 | 54 | 50 | 46 |

* Rows are the attacker’s ability score, columns the defender’s.  
* The entry gives the overall chance (in %) that the attacker wins the opposed check under the standard roll‑under rules:  

 1. Both roll 1d20.  
 2. If **attacker succeeds** and defender fails → attacker wins.  
 3. If **both succeed**, compare margins (score − roll); the higher margin wins.  
 4. **Ties go to the defender**, and the defender also wins whenever the attacker fails and the defender succeeds, or when both fail.

Thus an attacker with 12 facing a defender with 15 wins 32 % of the time, while the same attacker against a defender with 8 wins 25 % + another 21 % (for margin superiority) = 46 % overall, as reflected above.

### 3. FLUID POOL (LUCK / FORTUNE / INSTINCT)
**Luck** is a single track. Your Luck score equals the number of tokens you currently have.  
*Spend* a token after seeing a d20 roll to shift the die ± 1 (naturals 1 & 20 are immutable).  
When the GM calls for a Luck test, roll under **your current token count**.  
A calm rest restores 1 token; a milestone refills the track to its original cap (and may raise that cap by +1 if you spend build‑points on Luck).

| Moment | Luck tokens ( = current score ) | Effect on future “roll‑under‑Luck” tests |
|--------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Fresh start | 10 | 50 % chance of lucky break |
| After spending 4 | 6 | only 30 % chance now – risk bites |
| One night’s rest (+1) | 7 | 35 % – still shaky |
| Big milestone – pool resets | 10 | back to full shine |

**Why it works**

* **Tension ramps naturally.**  The more you bend fate, the harder it is to rely on it later.  
* **No extra maths.**  You already track the pool; the score is just “tokens left”.  
* **Milestone feel‑good.**  A reset (or a +1 cap increase) is now palpably valuable.

The GM can season that per setting: a sorcerous blessing might add +d4, a night on Martian rad‑dust maybe none at all.

Players can push LCK as hard as they dare.
* Starting Luck = baseline tokens (usually 10).  
* Current Luck score always equals tokens remaining.  
* **Spend any number** of tokens immediately after a roll to nudge the die ± 1 per token (natural 1 and 20 remain untouchable).  
* Tests that call for “roll under Luck” use the **current** (depleted) score.  
* Recover **+1 token** for a sound night’s rest, or more if the fiction grants a windfall.  
* **Milestone reset:** pool refills to baseline; you may spend build‑points to raise that baseline by +1 per 2 points.

_Example_  
Your rogue’s Luck is 8. You fail an important Reflex roll by 5. Desperate, you burn 6 Luck, shifting the result to a success—but your Luck drops to 2, making future Luck tests nearly hopeless until you can rest and, eventually, hit a milestone.

### Framing Luck—when to roll it, when to leave it alone

**Luck is not a “sixth skill.”**  
It’s the coin you flip when skill cannot plausibly decide the outcome—or when the universe itself is tilting one way or another.

#### When to call for a Luck test

1. **No attribute obviously covers the situation.**  
   *Example:* A rockslide thunders down while the party sleeps. Nobody’s REFLEX helps; nobody’s MIGHT can hold back tons of stone. Whether the boulders miss a sleeper is blind chance—roll under Luck.

2. **The character’s fate is inextricably tied to randomness or hidden forces.**  
   *Example:* Picking a sealed clay jar from a trader’s wagon; half contain bitter herbs, half contain precious resin. The choice is blind—Luck decides.

3. **As a hard fallback when an improvised plan teeters on the edge of credibility.**  
   *Example:* The rogue tries to guess which of three identical levers resets a lethal trap. No clues, no time—Luck or die.

4. **For sudden narrative twists outside the heroes’ control.**  
   *Example:* Will the lone patrol round the corner this very second?  
   The Custodian secretly rolls Luck for the scout to see if Fortune favours the stealthy approach.

*A good litmus test:* If you can reasonably argue that REFLEX, INTELLECT, or any other attribute could influence the result, use that attribute instead. Luck is the safety net only when the rope has truly vanished.

#### How Luck rolls feel in play

* **High Luck score (full tokens)** – the hero breezes through stray chance; the GM’s coin‑flip moments often break their way.  
* **Drained Luck** – now every random event is a loaded revolver. Players can *see* the danger: “I’ve only 2 Luck left—maybe we find real clues before guessing!”  

Because burning Luck to bend other rolls also shrinks the score, players constantly weigh *now* versus *later*. That friction is what makes the mechanic sing.

#### GM guidance

* Don’t over‑use Luck; once or twice per session keeps it special.  
* Let the table know when Luck is on deck—“No obvious attribute fits; give me a Luck roll.”  
* Success on a Luck test should feel like a narrow escape or serendipitous boon, not a routine win; failure should sting but not automatically kill.

### 4. HEALTH TRACK — STAMINA
Begin at **5 Stamina**. Generic damage is **1**. Light weapons add 0, standard arms +1, brutal ordnance +2. Armour (if setting allows) soaks 1–2. At **0 Stamina** collapse; death or rescue per fiction. Short rest +1 STM; thorough care +2.

---

### 5. PRESSURE TRACK
Every setting variant inherits a ready‑primed fuse: *(Doom, Shadow, Anomaly, Corruption — skin it to taste)*

| Step | Colour text (fantasy) | Colour text (sci‑fi) | Mechanical state |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 0 | Spirit calm | Timeline stable | nothing |
| 1 | Uneasy whisper | Data‑glitch | cosmetic flavour |
| 2 | Bad omens | Quantum flutter | minor GM moves, e.g. Disadvantage for one scene |
| 3 | Eldritch tremor | System alarms | serious side‑effect chosen by GM or player (see table) |
| 4 | Veil thins | Causality shear | power or pool use costs +1, NPCs grow hostile, etc. |
| **5 — Crisis** | **Backlash, possession, curse** | **Temporal implosion, AI seizure** | trigger a **Crisis event**, then reset track |

---

#### 1 . Earning Pressure  
* Whenever a character **deliberately tampers** with forces beyond normal ken (forbidden spell, paradox coil, broken taboo) the GM may call for a relevant attribute roll.  
* **Failure adds +1 Pressure.**  
* Certain dramatic bargains can add +1 outright.  
* Optional: group‑level Pressure that rises when the party as a whole crosses lines.

#### 2 . Living with Pressure  
At Steps 1–4 the GM uses the track as a tension dial: odd smells, equipment glitches, visions, NPC mistrust, disadvantage, rising costs for sorcery/tech. Keep it **fiction‑first, rule‑light**—the player should feel the heat, not track sub‑tables.

#### 3 . Purging Pressure *before* Crisis  
*During downtime* a character may attempt to shed Pressure. Pick a method that suits the setting:

* **Sacrifice / Burn Offering** — permanently lose 1 build‑point worth of stat (or a treasured item) to drop Pressure by 1.  
* **Cleansing Rite / Cool‑down Cycle** — spend a whole session in ritual, therapy, or recalibration. Roll an attribute (SPR, INT, etc.). Success removes 1 Pressure; failure removes none and wastes the chance.  
* **Story Quest** — the Custodian may set a mini‑objective (“return the stolen idol to its shrine”) that clears the track on completion.

Players can decide whether to pay the cost or ride the storm.

#### 4 . Step 5: Crisis Event  
When the fifth mark lands, the dam breaks immediately. Pick or roll:

| d6 | Crisis (reskin per world) | Aftermath |
|---|---------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Possession / Overload** — character loses control for one scene, GM plays them | Track resets to 0 |
| 2 | **Withering / Tech burnout** — lose 1 Stamina and a key item melts | Reset |
| 3 | **Nightmare Fugue / Feedback loop** — Disadvantage on all rolls next session | Reset |
| 4 | **Unwanted Summons / Time displacement** — party yanked to hostile locale | Reset |
| 5 | **Curse of Tongues / Data leak** — secret revealed, foes gain edge | Reset |
| 6 | **Roll twice** — stack the misery | Reset |

After Crisis the track always returns to **0** (or **1** if you like a lingering taint). Survivors can rebuild from there.

---

#### Why it sings

* **Single number, big drama.**  Players know exactly how close they are to the brink without micromanagement.  
* **Cost–benefit tension.**  Powerful but risky moves look tempting at low Pressure and terrifying at Step 4.  
* **Fiction‑driven purge.**  Clearing the track generates role‑play rather than rote rest.  
* **Adaptable skin.**  Swap “possession” for “tachyon backlash,” “curse” for “psychic fracture,” and the chassis hums in any genre.

### 6. COMBAT PROCEDURE (WHEN NEEDED)
1. **Attacker** rolls under appropriate attribute (Melee, Ranged, etc.).  
2. **Defender** rolls under own attribute (Dodge, Parry, Cover).  
3. Hit if attacker succeeds and defender fails; otherwise compare margins.  
4. Damage = 1 STM + weapon edge; apply armour soak.  
5. Natural 1 or margin >10 adds +1 damage.

Keep circumstances descriptive: flanking grants Advantage, fighting blind imposes Disadvantage.

Your instinct is sound: keep armour a single number but let precision (margin) eat into it instead of ladling on more dice. That preserves the “one roll settles it” mantra while solving the plate‑tank problem.

### A lean dynamic‑soak rule

1. **Armour has a base soak value** — 1 for leather / kevlar wrap, 2 for chain / composite plate, 3 for powered carapace, etc.  
2. **After a hit**, compare the attacker’s margin (*their score − their roll*).  
3. **For every full 4 points of margin, reduce soak by 1.**  
4. Any soak that remains subtracts from damage as usual (minimum 0).

Why “4”? Because one step of margin is 5 % of the distribution; four steps = 20 %. That’s big enough to feel but not so granular that the table has to count fiddly 1‑point swings.

#### Worked examples

| Attacker margin | Base armour 2 | Effective soak | Damage dealt* |
|-----------------|--------------:|---------------:|--------------:|
| 3  | 2 | 2 | Edge + 1 + **0** |
| 4–7 | 2 | 1 | Edge + 1 – 1 |
| 8–11 | 2 | 0 | Edge + 1 (full) |
| 12–15 | 2 | 0 | Edge + 1 (full) |

\*Assuming standard 1 STM base + weapon edge.

A heavy brute in plate (soak 3) still shrugs off glancing blows, but a deadly assassin rolling margins of 12 carves straight through.

#### Edge cases, rounded

* **Critical 1**: treat margin as maxed (ignore all soak).  
* **Critical 20**: attacker fails regardless; soak not needed.  
* **Armour vs. big guns**: If you like, say *explosive or plasma weapons ignore 1 point of soak before the margin calculation*.

#### Short rule text for the Codex

**Armour Soak**  
Leather soaks 1, mail or kevlar 2, plate or carapace 3. After a hit, reduce that soak by **1 for every 4 full points the attacker beat their target by** (round down). Whatever soak remains subtracts from damage. A critical success ignores all soak.

Margin is a lever the player can grab with Luck. After the attack die lands they now have three distinct questions in their head, all answerable by the same pool:

1. **Do I turn a miss into a hit?**  
2. **Do I push a glancing hit into a crit (natural 1 is untouchable, but a margin ≥ 10 often matters)?**  
3. **Do I spend extra Luck to chew through soak and finish the fight now?**

That interplay lets a cautious character bank Luck for the inevitable “roll under Luck” crisis later, while a risk‑taker burns hot in combat and hopes to rest before fate calls.

To make sure everyone’s on the same page you might slip a one‑liner into the Luck box:

> *You may spend Luck after a successful attack to lower the roll further, increasing your margin and thus wearing down armour.*

No new rules—just a reminder that the economy is live in that moment.

If we keep slicing fat at this rate we’ll hit Borges‑length any day now. Let me know what other gears you want to stress‑test.

### 7. CARRY LIMIT
Six substantial items ride comfortably; more invites Disadvantage on agility tasks. Tiny trinkets are free.

---

### 8. MILESTONES
Every **3–4 meaningful beats** (peril survived, revelation earned), grant a Milestone: **+1 Attribute** (max 16) *or* **+1 Stamina**, plus a setting‑themed boon—enchanted blade, favour of a tribe, patent royalties. Progress is narrative, not numeric grind.

---

### 9. NARRATIVE BEAT RHYTHM (GM AIDE)
Write scenes 200–500 words: *Hook → Action → Consequence* ending on tension. Offer **2–4 numbered options**, one risky or hidden. Track scenes as a directed graph; mark **Save Nodes** for rewinds on total defeat at a cost (Pool drain or +Pressure).

GM moves when players stall: escalate clock, reveal omen, shift terrain, propose harsh bargain.

---

### 10. TOOLKIT PLUG‑INS
The chassis invites light bolt‑ons:
• **Totem Marks / Heroic Feats** — once per session Advantage vs cost (Pool or Pressure).  
• **Ritual Magic / Tech Overload** — attribute roll; on failure add Pressure.  
• **Allies & Pets** — treat as small shared Pool that depletes with use.  
• **Stress Variants** — fear, corruption, radiation; same 0–5 track.

Plug only what serves tone; remove cleanly without cross‑threading stats.

---

### 11. AUTOMATED ROLLS & TRANSPARENCY
In AI‑assisted play, keep dice secret for suspense or show them for agency—your call. Use hidden code (`random.randint(1,20)`) to preserve neutrality; surface results, margins, and Pool‑spend offers.

*Strip it, paint it, bolt new armour—this engine purrs so long as a single d20 spins and a story’s heart beats.*
