**SINEW & STEEL — UNIVERSAL ROLL‑UNDER ENGINE**
*A skeletal system for narrative‑first roleplay, ready to wear any setting‑skin*

---

### 1. CORE PRINCIPLE
One die, one target: roll a **single d20**. If the result is **≤ attribute**, you succeed; higher, you fail. Everything else is flavour on that spine.

• **Natural 1** — extraordinary success.  
• **Natural 20** — catastrophic mishap.  
• **Advantage / Disadvantage** — roll two d20, keep lower / higher.  
• **Opposed Tests** — both sides roll; if both succeed compare **margin** (attribute − roll). Bigger margin wins.

Why roll? Only when outcome uncertainty meets meaningful stakes.

---

### 2. ATTRIBUTES
Choose **five** sliders; label to taste (Might, Reflex, Insight, etc.). Start at **10** each. To personalise: drop one attribute **‑2** to raise another **+1** (repeat as desired). Range **6–16** keeps odds sensible.

| Score | Chance to Succeed |
| --- | --- |
| 6 | 30% |
| 10 | 50% |
| 16 | 80% |

---

### 3. FLUID POOL (FORTUNE / LUCK / INSTINCT)
Pick one attribute to double as a **Pool**. Tokens = that score. After seeing a roll, spend tokens to nudge the die **±1 per token**. Cannot alter naturals 1 or 20. Recover **1 token per restful interval**; rare boons may refill more. Empty pool = mortal vulnerability.

---

### 4. HEALTH TRACK — STAMINA
Begin at **5 Stamina**. Generic damage is **1**. Light weapons add 0, standard arms +1, brutal ordnance +2. Armour (if setting allows) soaks 1–2. At **0 Stamina** collapse; death or rescue per fiction. Short rest +1 STM; thorough care +2.

---

### 5. PRESSURE TRACK — DOOM / SHADOW / ANOMALY
A second meter records cosmic or spiritual backlash. Name to taste. Certain risky acts call for an attribute roll; failure adds **1 Pressure**. At **5** the world pushes back—possession, storm, paradox, etc. Shed pressure only through costly rite, sacrifice, or dramatic act.

---

### 6. COMBAT PROCEDURE (WHEN NEEDED)
1. **Attacker** rolls under appropriate attribute (Melee, Ranged, etc.).  
2. **Defender** rolls under own attribute (Dodge, Parry, Cover).  
3. Hit if attacker succeeds and defender fails; otherwise compare margins.  
4. Damage = 1 STM + weapon edge; apply armour soak.  
5. Natural 1 or margin >10 adds +1 damage.

Keep circumstances descriptive: flanking grants Advantage, fighting blind imposes Disadvantage.

---

### 7. CARRY LIMIT
Six substantial items ride comfortably; more invites Disadvantage on agility tasks. Tiny trinkets are free.

---

### 8. MILESTONES
Every **3–4 meaningful beats** (peril survived, revelation earned), grant a Milestone: **+1 Attribute** (max 16) *or* **+1 Stamina**, plus a setting‑themed boon—enchanted blade, favour of a tribe, patent royalties. Progress is narrative, not numeric grind.

---

### 9. NARRATIVE BEAT RHYTHM (GM AIDE)
Write scenes 200–500 words: *Hook → Action → Consequence* ending on tension. Offer **2–4 numbered options**, one risky or hidden. Track scenes as a directed graph; mark **Save Nodes** for rewinds on total defeat at a cost (Pool drain or +Pressure).

GM moves when players stall: escalate clock, reveal omen, shift terrain, propose harsh bargain.

---

### 10. TOOLKIT PLUG‑INS
The chassis invites light bolt‑ons:
• **Totem Marks / Heroic Feats** — once per session Advantage vs cost (Pool or Pressure).  
• **Ritual Magic / Tech Overload** — attribute roll; on failure add Pressure.  
• **Allies & Pets** — treat as small shared Pool that depletes with use.  
• **Stress Variants** — fear, corruption, radiation; same 0–5 track.

Plug only what serves tone; remove cleanly without cross‑threading stats.

---

### 11. AUTOMATED ROLLS & TRANSPARENCY
In AI‑assisted play, keep dice secret for suspense or show them for agency—your call. Use hidden code (`random.randint(1,20)`) to preserve neutrality; surface results, margins, and Pool‑spend offers.

*Strip it, paint it, bolt new armour—this engine purrs so long as a single d20 spins and a story’s heart beats.*
