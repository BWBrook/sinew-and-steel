### **TWILIGHT OF THE NORTH-KINGDOM**
## Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*Eriador, late Third Age (T.A. 2950-3000).  The Dúnedain keep lonely watch, shadows gather in forgotten barrows, and humble folk cherish hearth-fires against the returning dark.*

## 🌄 WANDERER'S ADD-ON

| Core slot | Northern label       | Covers                                   |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Might     | **Strength (STR)**   | brawn, climbing ruins, orc-hewing        |
| Reflex    | **Nimbleness (NIM)** | stealth, archery, pony-handling          |
| Intellect | **Wisdom (WIS)**     | lore, riddles, subtle craft, Elvish song |

| Luck      | **Hope (HOP)**       | fate-tokens & inner light                |

### Hope & Fellowship

*Hope tokens* = current HOP score.  Once per scene a player may instead draw from a shared **Fellowship pool** (1 token per PC).  Spending from Fellowship bonds the company; when the pool empties, each PC gains **+1 Shadow**.

> “Mist pooled in the knife-cuts of the hills, silver in moon’s waning glow.”

### Cultural Knacks *(pick one)*

| Culture         | Knack            | Effect (1 HOP or +1 Shadow)                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Ranger**      | *Keen Eyes*      | Advantage on first WIS scan each locale.                        |
| **Dwarf**       | *Stout-Heart*    | Ignore an incoming +1 Shadow tick (once/session).               |
| **Elf**         | *Starlit Memory* | Spend 1 HOP for a yes/no lore truth from Keeper.                |
| **Bree-lander** | *Plain Speech*   | Advantage on first HRT barter or gossip roll in any settlement. |

### Weapons & Edges

| Weapon                          | Edge |
| ------------------------------- | ---- |
| Dagger, sling-stone             | 0    |
| Sword, spear, short bow         | +1   |
| Great spear, longbow, Dwarf-axe | +2   |

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Leather jerkin | 0 |
| Riveted mail | 1 |
| Hauberk & shield | 2 |

Dynamic soak applies; nat 1 cleaves.

*Fatal tag:* Troll club **Fatal (counter: heavy shield or dodge with Advantage)**.

## 📜 SUBTLE MAGIC — Elvish Rites

| Tier            | Cast with                 | Success cost                       | Failure cost                |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Whisper**     | WIS                       | none                               | none                        |
| **Rite**        | WIS                       | choose: spend 1 HOP *or* +1 Shadow | +1 Shadow                   |
| **Invocation**  | WIS (Hope cannot aid)     | +1 Shadow                          | +2 Shadow & Keeper backlash |
| **Unspeakable** | auto +2 Shadow, then roll | cost stands                        | Break immediately           |

Rites never hurl fire.  Examples: *Kindle Heart-Fire* (Rite), *Silence the Footfall* (Whisper), *Banish Barrow-Wight* (Invocation).

## 😓 FATIGUE — Journeys

*Each leg of a trek forces one test chosen by Guide:*
STR (rugged climb) • NIM (river ford) • WIS (navigation among ruins) • HRT (lead weary party).

*Fail = +1 Fatigue.*
At Fatigue 3+ every roll costs +1 Hope.  A night in true comfort clears all Fatigue; a campfire song clears 1 (see below).

**Song of Rest** — If a PC with HRT 12+ performs a song/story and passes HRT, every party member may recover **+1 Hope *or* clear 1 Fatigue**.

> “Cold stars mirrored on the barrow’s stones, yet none were as cold as the hush within.”

## 🌓 SHADOW TRACK (Pressure)

| Step         | Sign                                      | Effect                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0            | Bright spirit                             | —                                 |
| 1            | Gloom                                     | cosmetic foreboding               |
| 2            | Weight of worry                           | Disadvantage on next HRT vs dread |
| 3            | Dark whispers                             | All actions cost +1 Hope          |
| 4            | Twisted will                              | Disadvantage on every roll        |
| 5 **Fallen** | Corruption, despair, or servant of Shadow | Roll Shadow Crisis, reset to 1    |

**Gain Shadow:** witnessing evil, oath-breaking, treasure-greed, failing Invocations.
**Purge:** song at Elven haven, confession to Gandalf-like mentor, gift of treasure to the needy.

Shadow Crisis (d6):
1 Sudden greed — betray Fellowship pool (remove 1 token).
2 Black despair — helpless one scene.
3 Shadow tongue — Disadv social next session.
4 Night terrors — lose 1 HOP permanently.
5 Doom-mark — orcs sense you; ambush chance rises.
6 Roll twice.

## 📖 LOREMASTER'S CHRONICLE (GM Notes)

## Journey Roles (micro-TOR)

Assign up to three roles on any trek longer than a day.

| Role                    | Stat test each leg | On success                                | On failure                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Guide** (navigates)   | WIS                | stay on course                            | party gains **+1 Fatigue** each  |
| **Scout** (finds camps) | NIM                | safe campsite; clear 1 Fatigue for one PC | random hazard encounter          |
| **Look-out** (watches)  | HRT                | early warning → Advantage first round     | ambush; foes gain Advantage      |

If a role is unfilled, treat the test as an auto-fail.

---

## Councils & Entreaties

When PCs must sway Elrond, Butterbur, or a dwarven lord:

* Declare a **Council threshold** (3 for a petty king, 5 for Elrond).
* Each speaking PC rolls **Heart** (HRT) once; success = +1, failure = 0, nat 1 = +2, nat 20 = –1.
* Spend Hope before or after the roll as usual.
* Reach the threshold ⇒ favour granted; fall short ⇒ partial or refused.

Keeps social stakes high without new maths.

---

## Fellowship Phase (Downtime Undertakings)

After a completed adventure each PC picks **one undertaking**:

| Undertaking          | Effect                                                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Healing Rest**     | Clear all Fatigue *and* +1 Hope                             |
| **Research Lore**    | Ask Keeper one lore question; +1 Shadow on occult topics    |
| **Craft / Repair**   | Give one weapon or item **+1 edge** next adventure (max +2) |
| **Strengthen Bonds** | Add +1 token to Fellowship pool (up to starting max)        |

Downtime costs no dice; just narrate the off-season.

---

## Tainted & Hallowed Ground

* **Tainted** (old battle-field, barrow): Each night spent here → auto **+1 Shadow**.
* **Hallowed** (Elvish haven, Rivendell): First full night clears 1 Shadow and 1 Fatigue for each PC.

Travel choices acquire moral weight.

---

## ✍️ WRITING IN TOLKIEN STYLE

* **Elevate but stay clear.**  Use plain words woven with occasional high diction: “lo!,” “ere,” “fell.”
* **Landscape as character.**  Describe rolling heather, hush of pines, stars wheeling above Weathertop.
* **Hope amid sorrow.**  Even bleak moments hold a glimmer: a thrush singing, lembas sweetness.
* **Songs & genealogy.**  Sprinkle short couplets, ancestral references (“son of Arvegil”).
* **Eucatastrophe ending.**  Peril reaches darkest pitch, then a sudden turn—dawnlight, eagle cry, horn of Buckland.

---

## Loremaster’s Desk—Extra Advice

* **Season the calendar.**  Mention the waning of summer stars, harvest moons, the Fell Winter’s memory—Tolkien’s sense of time passing deepens atmosphere.
* **Let names carry history.**  NPCs drop shards of lore: “This blade was forged in Arthedain ere the Witch-king fell.” No exposition dump—just polish on dialogue.
* **Force clever combat.**  One troll > five orcs.  Reward tactics (flooded ford, flaming brand) over raw dice.
* **Shadow as carrot and stick.**  Offer tempting treasure with whispered malice; allow redemption scenes by gift-giving or renunciation.
* **Rain is drama.**  A Weathertop squall can add Disadvantage to missile fire, extinguish torches, and swell Fatigue—no monster needed.

---

## 🏡 SIDEBAR: SHIRE-ONLY ADVENTURE

* **Lower stakes, brighter tone.**  Replace Shadow with **Mischief** (0–5 track; 5 = Visit from the Bounders).
* Knacks: *Second Breakfast* (restore 1 Fatigue with a meal) • *Tookish Curiosity* (once/scene ask GM for a harmless clue).
* Fatal weapons banned; biggest peril is a river flood or Sackville-Baggins lawsuit.
* Journeys limited to day-trips; Song of Rest clears 1 Mischief instead of Fatigue.

---

## LOREMASTER'S MOVES

* **Opening beat**: greenway patrol finds black feather, or Hobbit fair pie contest disrupted by midnight theft.
* **Moves**: distant warg howl • red star glints over Amon Sûl • ranger beacon flare • chilling barrow breeze.
* **Pacing**: one lore clue, one peril, one respite, repeat.  Shadow rises fastest when greed tempts or courage fails.

> “A single yellow lantern danced in Bree’s west-gate, like hope holding vigil.”
