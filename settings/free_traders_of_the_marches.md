### **FREE TRADERS OF THE MARCHES**
## Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*Spinward Main, I.S.W. 1105.  Jump-flashes bloom in dark between the stars, patrons wave low-credit cargo chits, and a worn Type-A free-trader hauls dreams through the Third Imperium.*

_(Layer onto the universal rules; anything unmentioned defaults to core.)_


## 🚀  PLAYER ADD-ON

| Core slot | Marches label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Strength (STR)** | lug crates, melee, EVA clamp |
| Reflex | **Dexterity (DEX)** | vacuum pistol, pilot jink, quick patch |
| Intellect | **Education (EDU)** | astrogation, engineering, medical, xenolinguistics |
| Empathy | **Social (SOC)** | rank, bureaucracy, haggling, morale |
| Luck | **Fate (FAT)** | uncanny breaks **and** token pool |

### Fate tokens  
Stamped Imperial credits kept in a battered cred-clip.  A restful week in port + 1; high-grade liquor or Vilani meditation may restore more.

### Prior-Service Knacks *(pick one, cost 1 FAT or +1 Stress per use)*
| Knack | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Ex-Marine** | Once/scene treat one ranged attack as Advantage (ignore recoil/zero-G). |
| **Scout Surveyor** | Once/scene roll EDU astrogation with Advantage. |
| **Merchant Broker** | Once per trade cycle reroll the **Cargo Gamble** die and keep result. |
| **Noble Lineage** | Spend 1 FAT to pull rank: Advantage on SOC test with Imperial officials. |
| **Belter Rat** | Auto-pass a zero-G maneuver once/scene; gain +1 Stress if attempted in grav-zone. |

*“Jump-shock rippled your fillings; the vox hummed with residual static.”* 

### Expertise Die *(optional)*
Choose one stat as **Expertise**—pilot (DEX), engineer (EDU), liaison (SOC).  When an action sits squarely in that wheel-house, roll with Advantage.

### Weapons & Edges
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Blade, shock baton | 0 |
| Snub-pistol (gauss), shotgun | +1 |
| Laser carbine, ACR | +2 |

*Fatal tag:* Laser carbine vs unarmoured target — **Fatal (counter: any armour, reflective cloak).**

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Jack/flight suit | 0 |
| Combat cloth | 1 |
| Battle dress | 2 |

Dynamic soak applies; nat 1 burns through.

*“Dockmaster’s grin didn’t reach his eyes—even money smells desperate this far spinward.”*

## ⚙️  STARSHIP OPERATIONS MINI-GAME

**Jump Leg** — every parsec / week of travel:

| Role | Stat roll | Success | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Astrogator** | EDU | clean emergence | +1 Stress; on nat 20 **Misjump** (random hex, all PCs −1 STM, +1 Stress) |
| **Engineer** | EDU | fuel economy, no wear | +1 Stress *and* ship takes 1 armour-ignoring STM |
| **Watch Officer** | DEX or SOC | early pirate/hazard warning (Adv first round) | surprise encounter or red-tape delay |

If the crew leaves a role unfilled, treat that roll as automatic failure.

---

### Ship Shares (party pool)
Pool starts at **2 tokens** (or GM’s tone).  Spend a share to:

* Pay port fees or creditor bribe  
* Negate 1 point of ship damage  
* Replace a lost cargo load

Emptying the pool immediately gives **+1 Stress to every PC**.

## 📉  STRESS TRACK (Pressure)

| Step | Indicator | Effect |
|--|--|--|
|0|Green board|—|
|1|Amber caution|cosmetic: crew snappish, hull pings |
|2|High load|Disadv next Engineering or social roll |
|3|Over-taxed|All rolls cost +1 Fate |
|4|Red line|Disadv on all actions |
|5 **Break**|Panic, mutiny, or hull crisis|Roll Stress Crisis, reset 0 |

**Stress Crisis d6**  
1 Core flash-over — everyone −1 STM  
2 Helm panic — veer into hazard (encounter)  
3 Mutiny spark — social conflict, SOC rolls Disadvantage next session  
4 System lockdown — one ship function offline until port repair  
5 Debt call-in — lose 1 Ship Share immediately  
6 Roll twice

*Gain Stress:* combat hits, jump failures, overdue loan threats, empty Ship Shares.  
*Clear:* 72-hour shore leave (cost Cr), captain’s commendation (narrative), satisfying patron payoff.

FAT is self-risked; Stress reflects crew morale and system failure. The captain’s courage may cost the ship’s calm.

---

## 💰  CARGO GAMBLE  (each star-port visit)

Roll 1d6 (Merchant may reroll once):

1-2 Loss (−Cr 1 000) | 3-4 Break-even | 5 Profit (+Cr 1 000) | 6 Big score (+Cr 3 000, **+1 Stress** heat)

---

## 🩺  MEDICAL AID
**Med-kit (Usage d6).**  Roll EDU; success heals 1 STM.  Nat 20 → infection: patient gains +1 Stress.

---

Below are **optional bolt-ons and sidebars** you can splice into *Free Traders of the Marches* to echo 1977 Traveller subsystems and Steve Jackson’s *Starship Traveller* CYOA feel.  Add or ignore as suits the table.

## ⚠️ GUILDMASTER'S PROTOCOLS (GM Notes)

*“The Beowulf-class liner drifts dead-stick, running lights blinking in tired semaphore.”*  

## 🚨 Ship-to-Ship Combat (mini-module)

Treat the vessel as a single “character” when a quick dog-fight is all that’s needed.

| Stat               | Starting value                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hull (STM)**     | 6 for a 200-ton Free Trader (add +2 per displacement step) |
| **Screens (Soak)** | 1 if civilian sandcasters, 2 if military deflector grid    |
| **Turret Edge**    | +1 per armed turret; high-energy laser +2                  |

**Round:**

1. Each pilot rolls DEX; win = Advantage on next attack.
2. Gunner rolls DEX (edge applies) vs target pilot’s DEX defence.
3. Hit → dmg = 1 STM + turret edge – screens (dynamic soak still applies).
4. At **0 Hull**: drive disabled; boarding or boom per fiction.

*Missile salvo option*: Fire-and-forget; target rolls EDU to jam.  On hit, add +1 dmg but counts as spent rack.

---

## 🛡️ Away-Team Casualty Table (Redshirt Rule)

After any dangerous surface encounter where nameless crew accompanied PCs:

Roll d6 → casualties:

1 None
2 One redshirt wounded (−1 STM, med-kit needed)
3 One redshirt killed outright
4 Two wounded
5 One wounded, one missing (Keeper may reuse)
6 PC of GM’s choice takes stray hit (−1 STM)

Spice tension without tracking every NPC stat block.

---

## 🌌 Sector Event D6 (drop during any lull)

1 Pirate corsair shadowing — demand tribute or combat
2 Local noble requests jump-capable courier → lucrative patron
3 Solar flare: Comms blackout, DEX roll to protect sensors
4 Scout X-boat drops rumours of war on next main; +1 Stress
5 Merchant prince auctioning rare jump fuel (bid Cr or Ship Share)
6 Derelict liner beacons: salvage claim vs rescue ethics (Shadow-like dilemma)

---

## ⛽ Fuel Usage Die (simple logistics)

Jump fuel tanks = **Usage d8**.

* Each jump or misjump roll d8; on a **1** tanks empty → stranded, +2 Stress.
* Refuelling at star-port resets die; gas-giant skimming requires DEX pilot roll (fail = +1 Stress, ship −1 STM).

Keeps Traveller’s fuel loop without gallon math.

---

## 📖 FF-Style Branching Episode Tips (GM sidebar)

* Number your planned scenes (001–050).  Each ends with 2-3 choices labelled by number—players call a number; you flick pages “behind the screen.”
* Pair each node with a quick stat mantra: “001 – cargo hold / hazard roll / Stress +1 on fail.”
* Great for solo or duet play; dovetails with S\&S Save-Node rewinds (record paragraph numbers).

---

## ✍️ WRITING IN MILLER & CHADWICK REGISTER

* **Technical brevity.**  Use ship-registry strings: “Type-A2 Far Trader *Peregrine*, 200-ton.”  
* **Sparse wonder.**  A single vivid detail: “sunlight flares off the gas giant’s pale rings.”  
* **Understated danger.**  No pulp melodrama—pirates don’t cackle, they transmit terse ultimatums.  
* **Economic motive drives plot.**  Debt, fuel cost, speculative cargo boom; players feel every Cr-chip.  
* **Staccato comms.**  Dialogue uses clipped Naval phrases: “Lock nav-sol, mark vector 359-grid-alpha.”  
* **Hex references.**  Sprinkle coordinates: “Distress beacon in Gamma-March 2305.”  
* **Blue-book NPCs.**  A single line each: “Captain Orvoss, Navy retiree, SOC 11, hates smugglers.”

*Addendum to style guide*

* Present ship data in string blocks: “Beowulf-class 400-ton/Jump-2, P-4/E-1.”
* Keep economics concrete: Cr 7 500 cargo, Cr 3 000 port fee, 1 Ship Share ≈ Cr 10 000 equity.
* Default NPCs to competence 10; remarkable NPCs nudge 12–14 only.
* End transmissions with “Out.”  Radio silence breeds tension.
* Describe worlds with Universal World Profile shorthand, then one vivid line: “Glisten 0406 A434A9F-F — mirror seas split by obsidian ridges.”

## 🛰️  GUILDMASTER MOVES  

1. Port fees double; bank lien threatens to impound ship.  
2. Pirate corsair appears on long-range scan (DEX pilot vs ambush).  
3. Misfuelled jump fuel contaminates drive (+1 Stress, Engineer check).  
4. Patron offers time-critical chainglass shipment: high pay, higher risk.  
5. Lingering sickness on board (infection test or lose 1 STM).
