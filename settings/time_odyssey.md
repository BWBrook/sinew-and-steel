# **TIME ODYSSEY**
## Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*Victorian chrononautics in the spirit of H.G. Wells & John Wyndham.*

_(Paste atop the Sinew & Steel rules; anything not listed here follows the core.)_

## ⏳ CHRONONAUT'S CODEX
*A skin for H. G. Wells‑style excursions across the centuries*

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Time Odyssey label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Prowess (PRW)** | grit, melee, heavy labour |
| Reflex | **Reflex (REF)** | agility, evasive footwork, sleight |
| Intellect | **Intellect (INT)** | science, deduction, engineering |
| Empathy | **Empathy (EMP)** | persuasion, morale, reading motives |
| Luck | **Ingenuity (ING)** | lateral insight **&** token pool |

### Ingenuity Pool flavour
Tokens are brass cogs. Restful night +1; paradoxical boon or esoteric rejuvenator may restore more. Empty cogs leave travellers at time’s mercy.

### Weapons & Edges (typical era)
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Walking cane, punch | 0 |
| Cavalry sabre, pocket revolver | +1 |
| Arc‑rifle, pneumatic hammer | +2 |

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Tweed Coat | 0 |
| Leather riding jacket | 1 |
| Experimental alloy breastplate | 2 |

(Dynamic soak 1‑per‑4‑margin; nat 1 ignores all.)

### Temporal Anomaly (Pressure skin)
Meddling with history courts paradox. Certain feats—altering major events, meeting one’s past self, operating the machine under duress—require checks. Such acts call for INT or ING roll. Failure **+1 Anomaly**. At 5 trigger Crisis table then reset 0.

#### Crisis Table (d6)
1 Memory fracture — lose recent scene until reminded  
2 Equipment sublimates — key item vanishes in glitter  
3 Rip current — party hurled d10×1000 years off‑target  
4 Temporal echo — hostile duplicate of PC appears  
5 Reality blur — Disadvantage for next session  
6 Roll twice (stack)

### Equipment & Burden nuance
Six big items; brass‑and‑crystal **Time Machine** is always off‑screen. Currency shifts by era—bulky coinage invites thieves or customs scrutiny.

### Advancement Boon Seeds
After surviving a paradox cascade, cataloguing a prehistoric beast or shaping an epochal alliance, a **Milestone** and Boon might be awarded.  
Future‑alloy blade (+1 edge) • Patent rights (wealth advantage) • Eocene amber sample (sell for +3 Ingenuity refill) • Sphinx guardian favour (Adv once on EMP).

>*Ink these strictures upon vellum or etch them on a pocket brass plate—chrononauts who ignore them soon vanish into contradictory echoes.*

## 🔍 CUSTODIAN MANUAL (GM Guide)
*A guide for stewards of paradox, peril and Edwardian wonder*

### Narrative Tone
Brisk reportage, lyrical awe, with undercurrent of unease: Wells, Wyndham, Poe. Mix brass rivets and cosmic dread: “Ultramarine suns shimmered over a crystal sea as the machine’s valves hissed with protest.”

Present 2-4 options in second‑person imperative, focused on protagonist. Include at least one hidden or risky path. Example:  
> 1. Descend into the ventilator shaft.  
> 2. Retreat to the machine and recalibrate era coils.  
> 3. Trust the pale child’s silent gesture.  

Ensure consequences ripple across epochs—saving a single flower in 802,701 AD may cure a Victorian cholera outbreak.  
Wrap the boon in story: a Krao‑crystal implant grants +1 INT; Weena’s unwavering faith grants +1 EMP.

### GM Moves
Morlock ambush · Temporal storm blocks return · Rival chrononaut stakes claim · Faustian bargain: erase plague, gain +1 Anomaly.

### Luck (Ingenuity) Guidance
Call for ING test when blind chance or hidden quantum decides: which epoch‑rift opens, whether a stray bullet hits the machine. Keep to 1–2 per session.

### Epoch Graph
Track beats and parallel timelines with chronological tags (1895A, 802,701B…). Save Nodes cost –2 ING or +1 Anomaly to rewind.

>*Chrononauts are needles in the fabric of time; you, Custodian, are the hand that stitches and snips. Keep the thread taut.*
