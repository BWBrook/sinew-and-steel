**TIME ODYSSEY — ACTIVE CHRONONAUTS**

---

### GEORGE (the Time Traveller)
Victorian inventor driven by boundless curiosity and a dash of reckless courage.

Prowess 9 Reflex 11 Intellect 14 Empathy 10 Ingenuity 12 (Pool 12) Stamina 5 Anomaly 0/5

Equipment: pocket revolver (+1 damage, close range), brass goggles (advantage on vision‑related REF tasks), notebook & pen (advantage on INT deduction when consulted), miniature tool‑roll, slim coin‑purse of mixed eras, the grand **Time Machine** (parked off‑screen).

Notes: advantage on historical or scientific INT checks. Reputation for unorthodox theories makes Victorian peers wary.

### WEENA (Eloi Companion)
Gentle child of 802,701 AD, embodies innocence and quiet resilience.

Prowess 6 Reflex 9 Intellect 8 Empathy 14 Ingenuity 10 (Pool 10) Stamina 4 Anomaly 0/5

Equipment: simple Eloi garb, wiltflower charm (advantage when calming creatures or persons), glow‑stone bead (casts pale light), curiosity unburdened by era taboos.

Notes: instinctive trust from other Eloi or gentle beings; suffers disadvantage in harsh industrial ages; her presence reminds George of what is at stake in tampering with time.
