## ‚öîÔ∏è¬†SCROLL OF GRIM TALES (Player)

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Age Undreamed label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Brawn (BRN)** | raw strength, ferocity, melee power |
| Reflex | **Agility (AGI)** | speed, balance, tumbling |
| Intellect | **Cunning (CUN)** | stealth, guile, precision |
| Empathy | **Will (WIL)** | grit vs fear, mental steel, sorcery control |
| Luck | **Fortune (FOR)** | whim of the gods & token pool |

### Fortune Pool flavour
Tokens = wolf‚Äëtooth talismans. Rest by a safe hearth +1; priestly blessings or stolen relics may restore more.

### Weapons & Edges
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Fist, cudgel | 0 |
| Broadsword, war‚Äëaxe, short bow | +1 |
| Greatsword, long bow, sorcerous bolt | +2 |

Fists or blackjack cause subdual damage.

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Leather jerkin | 1 |
| Ring mail / hide coat | 2 |
| Steel plate & shield | 3 |

(Dynamic soak rule; nat‚ÄØ1 ignores all.)

A draught of wine by the fire: +1 STM after a scene‚Äôs calm rest; a full bed and ministrations +2. Severe wounds need a healer‚Äôs skill or potent herbs.

### Equipment & Burden:
A character may carry up to six substantial items‚Äîarmour, weapons, bundles, or large tools. Trinkets and small gear ride in pouches and don‚Äôt count against the limit.  Coin is an inconvenient necessity; carry too much, and brigands will smell it.  

### Sorcery
Steel is honest; spells are treacherous.  Any feat is *theoretically* possible, but risk scales brutally.

| Tier | Example intent | Roll | Cost if you **succeed** | Cost if you **fail** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Whisper** | Spark a torch, seal a minor wound, chill wine | WIL ‚â§ stat | none | add **+0 Doom** (just fizzles) |
| **Weave** | Hurl a flame bolt, cloud a guard‚Äôs mind, walk unseen a heartbeat | WIL roll; may burn Fortune to nudge | choose **1:** <br>‚Ä¢ spend **1 Fortune** <br>‚Ä¢ or lose **1 Stamina** | **+1 Doom** |
| **Wrack** | Shatter iron gates, summon shadow hound, freeze a river ford | WIL roll (no Fortune allowed) | **+1 Doom** *even on success* | **+2 Doom** *and* Controller chooses backlash |
| **Wyrd** | Rewrite memory of a city, call a storm-god‚Äôs spear | Automatic **+3 Doom** *then* roll WIL; nat 1 = legend, any fail = GM‚Äôs worst | success: tale echoes for ages | fail: immediate Backlash table |

#### Backlash table (d6)

1 Flesh withers (‚Äì1 STM)  
2 Possessed by minor demon one scene  
3 Blind for a day; third eye opens at night (+Adv on sorcery)  
4 Nearest ally gains +1 Doom with you  
5 Eldritch mark: foes sense you; Disadv stealth until purged  
6 Roll twice

#### Casting steps

1. Declare the effect and its **Tier**.  
2. Roll **WIL** (unless the tier is Wyrd) and apply Fortune burn rules if allowed.  
3. Apply costs and consequences from table.  
4. Narrate untamed fallout; increase Doom track as required.

**Rules of thumb**

* Whisper = cantrips; costs nothing but time.  
* Weave = combat tricks; Fortune or blood can power them.  
* Wrack = story shakers; even success scars the soul.  
* Wyrd = campaign-level sorcery; Doom will bite and history will buckle.

Natural 1 always ignores soak and doubles narrative punch. Natural 20 jumps to ‚Äúfail‚Äù column, plus Controller may add an extra Doom if it feels right.

_Sorcery is a bargain with things that do not love you. Spend Doom like coin, but remember the debt collector always comes before dawn._

### **Doom** (Pressure track)
Any occult feat ‚Üí WIL roll; **failure +1 Doom**.  
| Step | Portent | GM twist |
|--|--|--|
|0|Calm|‚Äî|
|1|Whispers|cosmetic omens|
|2|Blood sigils|minor Disadvantage|
|3|Mind tremor|NPC fear, rituals cost +1 Fortune|
|4|Veil thins|environment warps, +1 damage from sorcery backlash|
|5¬†Backlash|Possession / Withering|Trigger Doom Crisis, reset¬†0|

Doom purge: cleric rite, sacrificial pyre, or grim personal cost.

Doom Crisis (d6):
1¬†Demon grip ‚Äî lose control one scene  
2¬†Soul scar ‚Äî‚ÄØ‚Äì1‚ÄØSTM & gain eerie stigma  
3¬†Eldritch eruption ‚Äî area damage  
4¬†Mind shatter ‚Äî Disadv all rolls next session  
5¬†Curse brand ‚Äî foes scent you across leagues  
6¬†Roll twice.

### Totemic Feats
Once per session declare a "Heroic Act‚Äù: attempt cinematic stunt (kick from battlements, snap chain). Gain Adv; if roll succeeds add +1 edge or inflict status. Costs **1 Fortune**.

>*Ready your steel. The world kneels only to those who dare carve their saga.*

## üó°Ô∏è¬†CHRONICLER'S TOUCHSTONE (GM)

### Narrative Rhythm
Terse, muscular prose. Violence sudden; sorcery foul or uncanny. Civilisation decadent; heroes carve fate. Cursed sigils, rival factions, prophetic dreams.

Keep rolls sparse; heroes triumph more than they fail, yet peril must feel real. Use Advantage to reward cunning gambits, Disadvantage to punish hubris. Fortune is precious‚Äîrecover it slowly so its last flickers feel desperate. Hand out Doom sparingly but make its consequences unforgettable. Milestones should follow story logic, not arithmetic.

### Howardian Style Primer
Robert‚ÄØE.‚ÄØHoward‚Äôs voice is lean and sinewed. Keep sentences short, verbs vivid, adjectives sparing but potent. 

Emphasise physical sensation‚Äîiron, sweat, blood, stone. Let sorcery feel foul and wondrous, as much curse as gift. Characters reveal themselves through deeds, not ruminations. Lift the register only for moments of dread or grandeur, using archaic diction sparingly ("eldritch", "abysmal", "thews"). 

Violence is sudden; wonder is sombre; civilisation is decadent; fate is grim but defied.

### GM Moves
Cultists advance ‚Ä¢ Storm blackens sky ‚Ä¢ Bridge rots beneath feet ‚Ä¢ Blood on the moon ‚Ä¢ Hard bargain ‚Ä¢ Offer coin‚Äëfor‚Äëbetrayal.

Milestones arise after a climactic victory, survival of a perilous journey or the unearthing of a legendary secret.  
Tangible boons: an enchanted blade, a scar that cows peasants, the trust of a desert tribe.  

### Luck (Fortune) Guidance
Offer Fortune burn when failure is within range; remind players they can push margin deeper to shred armour.

### Beat & Graph
The tale unfolds in vivid, kinetic beats. Mechanics serve pacing; pacing serves mood. When in doubt, cut to action, raise a question, or unveil a terrible wonder.

Same core method; tag nodes by locale (Tomb¬†A1, Bazaar¬†B3). Save Nodes cost ‚Äì2¬†FOR or +1¬†Doom.

Failure should reshape the world, not halt the story. Death is meaningful only if it closes an arc or opens a darker one. Otherwise, maim, curse, or impoverish.
