AGE UNDREAMED OF — a compact rule set for grim sword‑and‑sorcery tales

This is a rules‑light, story‑driven RPG set for fantasy settings. The guiding principle is to keep gameplay fast, flexible, and narrative‑focused, with minimal bookkeeping.

**Core Mechanics:**

Uncertain actions that carry significant consequences are resolved with a single d20 roll: if the result is equal to or below the relevant attribute, it succeeds.

A natural 1 is a critical success, 20 a critical failure. Their impact is determined in context.

Advantage means roll two dice and keep the better; Disadvantage keeps the worse.

For opposed rolls, compare against relevant attributes: the greater margin of success prevails.

**Attributes:**

*Brawn* measures raw strength and ferocity in battle.

*Agility* is speed and balance.

*Cunning* covers guile, stealth, deception, and precision work.

*Will* is mental steel against fear, sorcery and madness.

*Fortune* is a pool of luck that can bend fate.

Beginning characters start with a pool of 50 points, to be spent across the six attributes. Allocations of 11‑13 cost 2 spend per point raised; 14‑16 (maximum) cost 3 spend per point.

*Stamina* is a measure of bodily endurance. There are no 'classes' but characters are thematic. Warriors start with 6 points. Sorcerers 3. Other themes have 4 or 5 stamina.

*Fortune* begins equal to its attribute score, and may be spent after seeing any attribute roll to shift the die up or down by one. Fortune may be spent after seeing the roll but before the outcome is described. One restful night restores a single Fortune. A roll under Fortune can check to see if fate favours you in crisis. A drained pool makes such checks riskier.

**Combat, Damage and Armour:**

*Attacker* rolls under Brawn (melee) or Agility (ranged).

*Defender* rolls under Agility if dodging or under Brawn if parrying with a shield.

If Attacker succeeds and Defender fails, a hit is scored. If both succeed, compare margins of success (how far under they rolled). If Attacker’s margin is better, a hit occurs.

*On a hit* the target loses one Stamina plus the weapon’s edge: minor weapons add nothing, a broadsword, war‑axe or magical bolt adds one, an legendary weapon two. A natural 1, or beating the foe’s margin by ten or more, adds another. Fists cause subdual damage.

*Armour* is blunt reality: leather rarely soaks anything; mail absorbs one point per blow; plate two. When Stamina falls to zero the victim collapses; death or maiming is a narrative call.

**Sorcery & Doom:**

Any occult feat demands a Will roll. Failure inflicts a point of Doom. Doom is a separate five‑step track: at five points eldritch backlash strikes—possession, insanity, withering—whatever suits the tale. Doom fades only through occult rites, saintly aid or grim sacrifice.

**Healing & Rest:**

A draught of wine by the fire restores one Stamina after a scene’s calm rest; a full bed and ministrations restore two. Severe wounds need a healer’s skill or potent herbs. Stamina can never exceed its maximum without milestone growth.

**Advancement Milestones:**

These arise after a climactic victory, survival of a perilous journey or the unearthing of a legendary secret—roughly every three or four dramatic beats. The Chronicler awards either one extra Stamina or raises one attribute by one point. It also potentially grants a tangible boon: an enchanted blade, a scar that cows peasants, the trust of a desert tribe.

**Equipment & Burden:**

A character may carry up to six substantial items—armour, weapons, bundles, or large tools. Trinkets and small gear ride in pouches and don’t count against the limit. Coin is an inconvenient necessity; carry too much, and brigands will smell it.

**Guidance for the Chronicler:**

Keep rolls sparse; heroes triumph more than they fail, yet peril must feel real. Use Advantage to reward cunning gambits, Disadvantage to punish hubris. Fortune is precious—recover it slowly so its last flickers feel desperate. Hand out Doom sparingly but make its consequences unforgettable. Milestones should follow story logic, not arithmetic.

Ready your steel. The world kneels only to those who dare carve their saga.
