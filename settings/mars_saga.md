# **MARS SAGA**
## Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*Gritty exploits on a colonised Red Planet, circa 2205 AE.*

_(Staple onto the universal rules; anything unstated defaults to core.)_

## 🚀 COLONIST'S HANDBOOK (Player)
*A fast‑moving toolkit for hard sci‑fi adventuring.*

---

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Mars label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Attack (ATK)** | firearms, blades, throwing, brute violence |
| Reflex | **Defence (DEF)** | dodging fire, reactive shields, evasive driving |
| Intellect | **Skill (SKL)** | hacking, piloting, repair, sleight |
| Empathy | **Mind (MND)** | composure, persuasion, mental shock, psionics |
| Luck | **Luck (LCK)** | fortune & expendable pool |

### Luck Pool flavour
Tokens are battered cred‑chits. Restful sol in safe habitat +1 LCK; stim packs or narrative boons may restore more.

### Weapons & Edges (baseline colony tech)
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Combat knife, sap | 0 |
| Service pistol, boarding sabre | +1 |
| Laser carbine, flechette rifle, thermal cutter | +2 |

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Kevlar wrap or reinforced vac-suit | 1 |
| Composite plate / powered hardsuit | 2 |
| Golum battlearmour | 3 |

(Dynamic soak: −1 soak per 4 attacker margin; nat 1 ignores all.)

*Recovery*: a short breather with clean water +1 STM; a full med‑bay cycle or expert field surgeon +2 STM. Critical injuries require advanced med‑gel, cybernetic grafts or an ice‑bath in the autodoc.

### Equipment & Burden
Six big items (long guns, bulky toolkits, sealed cargo). Extra load ⇒ DEF Disadvantage. Too much digi-coin draws attention from Syndicate footpads and corp‑security alike.

### Psionics  
Hard vacuum, cobalt storms and stray solar flux have coaxed a minority of colonists into weak **M-field sensitives**.  Psionics ride the **Mind (MND)** stat and slot in beside guns and hacks—no extra dice.

| Step | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Activate** | Roll under **MND**.  Spend Luck as usual to tweak the die. |
| **On success** | The chosen effect manifests (see table).  Extra margin = stronger or subtler at the Controller’s discretion. |
| **On failure** | The attempt flares on corporate scanners: **+1 Heat** *and* you suffer Disadvantage on the next psionic roll this scene. |
| **Costs** | Each use drains **1 Stamina** (nose-bleeds, neural shock).  You may instead burn **1 Luck** to ignore the fatigue. |

#### Quick Power Menu
| Power | Baseline effect |
|---|---|
| **Telepathic Probe** | Read surface thoughts of one target in line of sight.  Margin ≥ 8 lets you lift buried memories. |
| **Kinetic Shove** | Inflict 1 STM (no edge) or knock a human-sized target prone; margin ≥ 4 can hurl across the room. |
| **Neuro-Veil** | For one minute hide your presence from basic sensors / cams; margin ≥ 6 cloaks an adjacent ally too. |
| **Chrono-Glitch** | Glimpse a possible outcome of the next scene (Controller gives a one-sentence omen).  Margin ≥ 10 lets you ask a yes/no follow-up. |

Psionics can’t pierce ablative psi-mesh helmets (rare, expensive) and never alter natural 1s or 20s.

Because each miss spikes **Heat**, repeat misuse draws Corp-Sec “mind-scrub” squads in a hurry. Use sparingly; the Red Planet already wants your mind.

### Pressure Track — **Heat**
Illegal ops raise corporate and Syndicate scrutiny.
| Step | HUD colour | GM effects |
|--|--|--|
|0|Green|Clear |
|1|Blue flicker|Cosmetic: rumours, routine scans |
|2|Yellow|Minor Disadvantage on black‑market deals |
|3|Orange|Bounty posted; NPC suspicion |
|4|Red|All risky moves cost +1 Luck; habitats lock doors |
|5 Crisis|Crimson alert|Trigger Heat Crisis, reset to 0|

**Gain Heat**: failed covert rolls, public gunfire, data hacks traced, reckless media leaks.  
**Clear Heat**: pay bribes (lose creds/item), lay low an entire session, or perform favour for controlling corp.

**Heat Crisis** (d6):  
1 Corp‑Sec raid (combat or surrender)  
2 Syndicate kidnaps ally  
3 Bounty hunters strike en route  
4 Bio‑sensor lockout: habitat denies life support  
5 Universal arrest warrant (Disadv all social next session)  
6 Roll twice and stack.

### Milestone Boon Seeds
Salvage permit (once ignore Heat +1) • Dome Elder favour (Adv one social scene) • Pre‑Collapse alloy blade (+1 edge) • Hidden cache (refill Luck pool mid‑run) • Scrambler code (Adv on next hack).

## 🛰️ CONTROLLER'S DOSSIER (GM)
*An operational brief for weaving intrigue, peril and dust‑choked wonder across the Red Frontier*

---

### Red‑Dust Tone
Prose lean, verbs vivid, adjectives scarce yet potent. Chandler on Olympus Mons: “Dust devils danced along the mag‑rail as jetting exhaust etched rust on the sky.” Tech is rusting, corps are bloated carrion birds; wonder haunts ghost domes. Keep the fiction kinetic. Frontier hardship, social stratification, profit vs. survival, mysterious disappearances.  

Defeat should twist the story rather than break it. A firefight loss might mean incarceration in a polar mine, not a campaign’s abrupt end. Death closes an arc only when it crowns pathos; otherwise grant mutilation, debt, or a memory‑wipe implant.  

### Martian Lore
Established by Paramount Mining Corporation after ilmenite reserves. Four underground settlements: Primus (original), Parallax (new, crime-ridden), Progeny (science station), Proscenium (outpost under construction: contact mysteriously lost). 

Life-forms lurk in the sands: crushers, scorads, sand lions, dust worms, urchins, human nomads. 

Kit: Arc-gun (spray), Vibro-blade, Flechettes, Golum armour, Vac-suits, Kevlar wrap, Laser carbine, pulse laser, etc.

### Beat & Graph notes
Open with a sensual hook — sand rasping against a visor, the antiseptic sting of med‑gel — follow with decisive action and finish at a fork. 

Ambushes, decompression hazards, psychic echoes of ancient Martian ruins, white-corridor bordem, clatter of chance cubes, settlement power fails, dust devils scour the landing pads.  

Same core beat form; tag nodes by dome/quadrant (PR‑01, VM‑A2). 

Save Nodes cost –2 LCK or +1 Heat to rewind: cost of an amputated limb, a spike in corporate debts.

### Tricks & Tactics
Creative stunts are encouraged. Fire suppression foam may smother a plasma arc, a grappling drone can provide a swift exfiltration. Reward ingenuity with Advantage or extra narrative leverage. When in doubt favour bold action but remember that every triumph on rust‑red soil comes smeared with dust and danger.

### GM Moves
Life‑support warning • Rail‑cannon test quake • Terraformer glitch kicks up storm • Corp auditor arrives.  
After a heist concluded, a secret unearthed or a sand‑storm crossing survived, the Controller may grant a Milestone.

### Luck (LCK) Guidance
Call Luck when chance, bureaucracy, or random supply crate decides. One‑two per session—Mars is harsh but not roulette.

>*Use this dossier like a smuggler’s map—scribble notes in the margins, spill coffee on it, cross out old threats and ink in fresh ones. Mars is alive, merciless and waiting.*
