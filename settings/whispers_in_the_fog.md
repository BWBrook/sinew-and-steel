### **WHISPERS IN THE FOG**  
## Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*Mournful New-England shores, 1924.  Gas-lamps gutter, marsh-mists coil, and nameless shapes lurk just beyond the churchyard wall.*  

_(Paste atop the universal rules; anything not listed there defaults to core.)_

>*“Eli’s match flared, briefly revealing a smear of wet footprints that began in the centre of the room and led nowhere.”*

>*“Somewhere beneath the hymn of the surf, a deeper cadence throbbed… like the slowed heart of a behemoth dreaming in pitch.”*

### Lantern & Battery  

*Hooded Lantern (Usage d6)* • *Electric Torch (Usage d6, waterproof)*

* **Usage Die d6** for any portable light source (lantern oil, flashlight battery).  
* Each time the light is stressed—knocked, doused, long exploration—roll the die.  
  * On **1**, the light sputters out; refuel or embrace darkness (AGI rolls at Disadvantage, +1 Insanity tick every ten minutes).  
  * On **2-6**, keep going.  
* Fresh fuel/batteries reset the Usage Die.

>*“A lantern swung in the fog, tracing impossible angles—yet each swing returned to the same ghastly intersection of shadow.”*

### Keeper’s Quill — Writing in Lovecraftian Tone  

* **Antiquate sparingly.**  One archaic verb per paragraph (‘betokened’, ‘antediluvian’) is perfume; a whole bouquet is parody.  
* **Layer sensory dread.**  Sight-smells-sounds in quick succession: “salt-reek, pulsing lavender glow, distant surf that pounded like vast respirations.”  
* **Imply the shape, deny the whole.**  Describe edges, textures, odours—never the full anatomy of the horror.  Let the reader’s cortex finish the sketch.  
* **Cosmic scale through comparison.**  “Its shadow swallowed the lighthouse as a gull swallows a grain of sand.”  
* **Use fragile narrators.**  PCs mutter doubt, stumble on diction: ellipses, dashes, unfinished clauses mirror fraying psyche.  
* **Slow verbs, sudden violence.**  Ten lines of oppressive hush, then one splintering gun-shot or roof-beam collapse.  
* **Finish scenes with existential dread, not triumph.**  Even victories taste of spoiled brine and scorched vellum.  
* **Let knowledge hurt.**  Reward Scholarship with answers that cost sanity; each new fact should feel like a bargain struck at midnight.

>*“In the ledger’s margin, the ink had crusted to a curious verdigris, as though the word itself resented daylight.”*

## 😱 FLAVOUR PALETTE (Keeper cues)

* **Sights**: fog halos the gas-lamps; moonlit marsh reeds sway like skeletal fingers.  
* **Sounds**: distant buoy-bell, wet slither beneath floorboards, a church clock that skips the chime for two o’clock.  
* **Smells**: brackish tide-mud, old books stained with vinegar, acrid cordite lingering after a single shot.  

**Keeper moves:**  
* Church bell tolls backwards • Tidal surge floods cellar steps • Cultist chant echoes from crypt • Thin crack opens in sky, showing alien stars.

## 🗺️ EPISODE STRUCTURE (one-shot model)

1. **Cold open.**  Newspaper clipping or funeral sets the hook.  
2. **Investigation web.**  Three core locales (abandoned church, docks, upland woods).  
3. **Rising dread.**  Each locale threatens +Insanity or physical harm.  
4. **Clock.**  Cult ritual reaches zenith at midnight unless disrupted.  
5. **Finale.**  Banishment rite, dynamite collapse, or escape while elder thing feeds.  
6. **Aftermath.**  Survivors scarred; reputations tattered.

Stylistic rule: pain is concrete, hope is whispered, knowledge always costs.

>*“Knowledge is not a ladder but a pit; one descends, rung by foolish rung, until the sky is a memory.”*
