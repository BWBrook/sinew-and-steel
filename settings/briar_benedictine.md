| 4 | Siege engines rumble outside; the abbot‚Äôs ring is stolen. | The culprit left a scrap of *royal* livery, not rebel colours. |
| 5 | The infirmary leech-jar is missing; patients worsen. | An apothecary in town pays double for rare blood elixir. |
| 6 | A parchment map to a Saxon tomb appears in Cadoc‚Äôs cell. | The hand-writing matches the Prior‚Äîdead these ten years. |
