**MARS SAGA — ACTIVE OPERATIVES**

**TOM JETLAND**
Roguish spacer marooned on the Red Frontier, silver tongue masking weary pragmatism.

Attack 13 Defence 11 Skill 12 Mind 10 Luck 8 (Pool 8) Stamina 6

Equipment: laser carbine (damage +2 at close or long, ‑1 in melee), basic handgun (+1 damage, close range), kevlar wrap (soaks 1 or grants +1 to Defence, Controller’s call), omni‑tool (may grant Advantage on repair or hack), mixed ammo packs, modest cred‑chits.

Notes: streetwise contacts, advantage on shady social or stealth tests in neon‑lit alleys. Currently solvent enough to eat, broke enough to take risks.

**MIIRA**
Composed hacker steeped in Martian network lore, preferring code to gun‑smoke.

Attack 9 Defence 10 Skill 14 Mind 12 Luck 10 (Pool 10) Stamina 5

Equipment: datapad and probes (+1 to Skill when hacking), light sidearm (+1 damage, close range), satchel of cables and parts, civic vac‑suit (no soak), carefully hoarded creds, emergency ration pack.

Notes: calm under fire, known crash‑pad in Primus for covert ops, avoids direct firefights but will squeeze a trigger when cornered.

All numerical pools should be updated in session as Luck is burned or Stamina bleeds away. Keep space for scars, grudges and salvage. The Red Planet remembers every mark.
