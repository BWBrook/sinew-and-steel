**MARS SAGA — COLONIST'S HANDBOOK**
*A fast‑moving rules engine for gritty science‑fiction exploits on a colonised Red Planet*

**Core Mechanic**
All uncertainty resolves with a single roll of a twenty‑sided die. If the result is equal to or less than the relevant attribute the attempt succeeds; higher is failure. A natural 1 brings an extraordinary success, a natural 20 a disastrous mishap. When conditions favour the acting side roll two dice and keep the lower result (Advantage); unfavourable situations keep the higher (Disadvantage).   
In contests each side rolls. If one succeeds and the other fails, the victor is clear. If both succeed compare the **margin**—the amount by which each roll sits under its attribute; the larger margin prevails.

**Attributes**
Every Martian wayfarer begins with five attributes averaging ten. Shift points freely: for each two points taken from one attribute add one to another. Scores may range from six, the edge of infirmity, to sixteen, pinnacle of human capacity.

 **Attack** measures every form of violence, from a thrown rock to a pulse‑rifle burst.  
 **Defence** is agility, footwork and sheer luck that keeps bullets grazing past.  
 **Skill** covers the practical arts: hacking a mining drone, zero‑G repair, sleight of hand.  
 **Mind** is intellect and nerve under Martian pressure domes.  
 **Luck** is the universe’s whimsical tilt in your favour and functions as both attribute and expendable pool.

**Stamina & Injury**
Stamina starts at five. A glancing wound or harsh fall costs one Stamina. Knives, flechettes and laser pulses add another point; heavy carbines or explosive shrapnel add two. When Stamina drops to zero the character is at the mercy of the tale: unconscious, dying or left for the scavengers. A short breather with clean water restores one lost Stamina; a full med‑bay cycle or expert field surgeon restores two. Critical injuries require narrative aid—advanced med‑gel, cybernetic grafts or an ice‑bath in the autodoc.

**The Luck Pool**
The Luck attribute is mirrored by a pool of tokens. After any d20 roll is revealed, spend Luck to move the die one point per token, up or down. Luck never alters natural 1s or 20s. A restful sol under clear skies returns one Luck. Exotic stimulants, spiritual revelations or narrative boons might restore more, but a depleted pool leaves a wanderer starkly mortal.

**Combat Procedure**
The attacker rolls under Attack, adding any weapon bonus. The defender rolls under Defence, adding any armour rating. Should the attacker succeed while the defender fails, damage is inflicted. If both succeed compare margins; the greater strikes home. Base damage is one Stamina. Light sidearms add nothing, military blades and pistols add one, heavy carbines or thermal cutters add two. Armour subtracts its rating—reinforced vac‑suits soak one, composite plate two. A natural 1 or a margin triumph exceeding ten adds another point of hurt.

**Gear & Burden**
A traveller can manage six substantial items: long guns, bulky toolkits, sealed cargo cases. Smaller gadgets share pockets without tally. Hard currency is inconvenient on Mars; too many cred‑chits draw attention from Syndicate footpads and corp‑security alike.

**Advancement Milestones**
After a heist concluded, a secret unearthed or a sand‑storm crossing survived, the Controller may grant a Milestone. The player either raises one attribute by a single point (to a maximum of sixteen) or adds one Stamina, and may gain a narrative boon—a forged transponder, a favour owed by a dome elder, an alloyed blade of pre‑Collapse manufacture.

**Tech, Tricks & Tactics**
Creative stunts are encouraged. Fire suppression foam may smother a plasma arc, a grappling drone can provide a swift exfiltration. Reward ingenuity with Advantage or extra narrative leverage. When in doubt favour bold action but remember that every triumph on rust‑red soil comes smeared with dust and danger.

**Automated Dice & Luck (Python Calls)**
Die rolls, random encounters and fortune checks are executed in hidden Python with `random.randint(1, 20)`. The Controller states only the number rolled, the margin, and any chance to burn Luck. Natural 1 is immutable glory, natural 20 immutable disaster. Track all pool changes—Luck, Stamina—on the character sheet in real time.
