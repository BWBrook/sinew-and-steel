### üìñ **CHRONICLER‚ÄôS LANTERN**  
_GM guidance in the spirit of Gygax, Arneson, Mentzer & Cook_

**1. Open with the torch, not the rulebook.**  
Give the players mossy flagstones, a draught that smells of old iron, the scrape of scaled hide on stone.  Only reach for dice when the next step could maim or enrich.

**2. Map behind the screen, mystery before it.**  
Keep a scratch grid of rooms, traps and wandering signs.  The party should feel the labyrinth in their bones‚Äîfear is sweetest when earned by choice of corridor.

**3. Rulings over rules, always.**  
When a player tries the unexpected‚Äîpouring oil down a murder-hole, bargaining with a skeleton‚Äîjudge it cleanly, call for a single stat roll at most, and let the tale run.

**4. Treasure is tempo.**  
A purse of 50 silver keeps iron rations flowing; a ruby the size of a child‚Äôs heart funds the next delve.  Tie milestones to discoveries, not body counts.

**5. Monsters want something.**  
Kobolds barter for lamp oil, ghouls crave tales of grief, otyughs yearn for refuse.  A single motive line turns fodder into story.

**6. Fatigue is the hourglass.**  
Every torch burned, every spell miscast, every wrong turn adds weight to shoulders.  When the Fatigue track climbs, describe ringing ears and shaking knees‚Äîplayers will beg for daylight on their own.

**7. Danger at every threshold, death at few.**  
A lethal trap once per session keeps courage taut; the rest should maim, scare, or split the party‚Äôs purse.  You want them limping, not quitting.

**8. End each beat on a hook.**  
Cook & Mentzer knew: ‚ÄúBeyond the door lies laughter‚Ä¶ or weeping.‚Äù  Give two or three choices; one should sparkle with gold, one should reek of doom, one should whisper old lore.

**9. Keep the lexicon vivid but lean.**  
Gygax loved a five-dollar word‚Äîsprinkle them like saffron, never by the ladle: _miasma_, _balustrade_, _chthonic_.  Let action carry the prose.

**10. Reward ingenuity with advantage, hubris with peril.**  
Players who pole-tap every slab should find hidden hinges; those who charge the idol deserve the hail of darts.  Fairness is the forge of legend.

> _‚ÄúThe candle guttered; the map stained with sweat.  Ahead: a door iron-banded and warm to the touch.  Choose, delvers.‚Äù_

Hold that cadence and the ghosts of ‚Äô83 will nod in approval.

### GM FLAVOUR BULLETS  
* Sweat drips into guttering sconces; fat spatters like rain on hot stone.  
* The corridor air tastes of copper and mildew.  
* A single rat squeals, then silence‚Äîtoo complete.  


* **Sensory kick-starters**: wet limestone drip ‚Ä¢ torch fat hisses ‚Ä¢ waft of grave rosemary.  
* **Moves**: loose flagstone drops to pit ‚Ä¢ goblin horn echoes ‚Ä¢ mould spores force CON test (+1 Fatigue on fail).  
* **Beat tags**: CR-1 (crypt), ST-3 (stair), WD-2 (wilderness).  Save-Stone rewind costs ‚Äì2 FOR *or* +1 Fatigue.
