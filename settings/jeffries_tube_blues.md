### **JEFFRIES-TUBE BLUES — SKIN ADD-ON FOR SINEW & STEEL**  
## Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*Life below decks on an Alpha-Quadrant starship, starbase or station, Stardate 47 –––.*

## 🛠️ STARFLEET TRAINING

| Core slot | Starfleet label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Muscle (MSC)** | heaving plasma manifolds, hand-to-hand shoves |
| Reflex | **Reflex (REF)** | EVA manoeuvres, jefferies-crawl, quick reroute taps |
| Intellect | **Systems (SYS)** | diagnostics, warp theory, programming, tricorder scans |
| Empathy | **Harmony (HAR)** | morale boosts, mediation, reading alien subtext |
| Luck | **Resourcefulness (RES)** | miracle fixes **and** token pool |

### Resourcefulness flavour  
Tokens are colour-coded iso-linears in a pocket case.  A full sleep cycle in quarters +1; Vulcan meditation or replicated raktajino may restore more.

### Tools & Edges  
| Tool / Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Engineering kit bash, stun baton | 0 |
| Type-1 phaser (stun), hyperspanner torque | +1 |
| Type-2 phaser (stun/kill), micro-torque laser | +2 |

*(Starfleet regs: lethal setting adds +1 **Stress** automatically.)*

### Uniform & Soak  
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Duty uniform (with force-field weave) | 1 |
| Tactical vest | 2 |
| Personal energy shield (PES) | 3 |

Dynamic soak still applies; nat 1 bypasses shields.

### Operations  
* **“Reroute!”** — once per scene declare a systems miracle; spend **1 RES** for Advantage on a SYS roll that patches power, re-phases shields, etc.  
* **“Technobabble Buffer.”**  Spend **2 RES** after a failed SYS roll to narratively delay the failure one beat (gives team time to react). Costs +1 **Stress** if still unresolved next scene.

* **Division Override** *(once per scene)*  
Thumb-twist your combadge stripe to another division colour.

| Stripe chosen | Gain Advantage on… | Narrative perk | Cost |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------|------|
| **Gold – Ops / Security** | Muscle **or** Reflex rolls to restrain, firefight, EVA repair | Security-locker phaser type-1 is “conveniently nearby.” | **1 RES** *or* +1 Stress |
| **Blue – Science / Medical** | Systems (analysis) **or** Harmony (triage) | Custodian must reveal one hard data point about the anomaly. | 1 RES *or* +1 Stress |
| **Red – Command / Flight** | Harmony (orders) **or** Systems (helm, shuttle) | You may shift 1 Stress from yourself to the ship’s alert status (narrative only). | 1 RES *or* +1 Stress |

*Limits:* only one flip per scene; can’t flip at Stress 4 if out of RES.

### Tricorder Protocol  
| Mode | How to use | What you get | Cost / Risk |
|------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Quick Scan** | Roll **SYS** with Advantage | One concrete data point | none |
| **Deep Scan** *(once per scene)* | Spend **1 RES** *or* +1 Stress, roll SYS (normal) | Ask two yes/no questions the Custodian must answer truthfully | cost above |
| **Overload Push** | After a **nat 20** on any scan, burn **2 RES** to salvage partial reading | Avoid failure; tricorder fries until repaired (simple SYS) | 2 RES & device offline |

>(Starfleet regs: modifying sensor interlocks without authorisation adds +1 Stress.)

## ⚠️ COMPUTER SYSTEMS (GM Notes)

### **Stress** Track (Pressure skin)

| Step | LCARS hue | Shipboard effect |
|--|--|--|
|0|Blue-calm|—|
|1|Green blip|Cosmetic: warning chimes|
|2|Yellow|Disadvantage on time-sensitive repairs|
|3|Orange|Section lockdowns, NPC suspicion|
|4|Red alert|All actions cost +1 RES; senior staff glare|
|5 **Crisis**|Breach klaxon|Roll Stress crisis, reset 0|

**Gain Stress:** failed covert repairs, phaser fire in public corridors, ignoring safety interlocks, “Technobabble Buffer” overrun.  
**Reduce:** shore leave, captain’s commendation, spotless inspection.

**Crisis table (d6)**  
1 Warp core cascade—EVA scramble or eject core  
2 Containment loss—radiation damage 1 STM to all in section  
3 JAG inquiry—Disadv social with command next session  
4 Borg nanite alarm—SYS roll or lose key system  
5 Shipwide lockdown—travel restricted, timers tick  
6 Roll twice

#### 6. Showrunner Notes — Writing a Trek-Era Episode  

1. **Cold-open hook (≤ 150 words).**  A jefferies conduit ruptures, a quantum echo hums, or an irate Bolian demands a plasma shower.  End on the red-alert klaxon.  
2. **A-/B-plot rhythm.**  Keep one technical crisis (EPS overload) and one interpersonal thread (crewman’s secret holonovel).  Alternate scenes.  
3. **Dialogue first, dice second.**  Let players techno-babble a plan; only roll when the core might blow or a superior officer remains unconvinced.  
4. **Roddenberry optimism with friction.**  No grimdark—conflict is creative, not cruel.  Even the Borg drone may seek liberation.  
5. **Montage beat.**  Use a single Systems roll plus Division Override to cover bypass-reroute-weld sequences; summarise sparks on bulkheads, sweat on brows.  
6. **Act-break cliff-hangers.**  Every 2–3 beats hit: *“Warp core breach in 120 seconds”* or *“Captain on comm: ‘Ensign, explain the phaser discharge in Shuttle Bay 2.’”*  
7. **Stinger epilogue.**  Show the repaired conduit humming; crew share replicated pie in the mess; one faint LCARS chirp hints at next episode.

> *“The plasma flow stabilises, lights returning to cool blue.  Ortiz exhales—then a proximity klaxon screams.  Something massive drops from warp right atop their vector…”*  

Roll opening credits.

### Bridge-Deck Flavour bullets  
* Plasma conduits hum like distant thunder.  
* Antimatter containment lights flicker, bathing bulkheads mauve.  
* Corridor air tastes of ozone and burnt peach.  
* A single annunciator chirp can still hearts across ten decks.

### GM Moves  
Power surge shorts Jeffries node • Plasma leak clouds maintenance bay • Redshirt drops tool tray, sets off motion sensor • Captain on comm: “I need that EPS grid in three minutes, ensign.”

### Beat tags  
Label nodes by deck/section: ENG-D4, SCI-B2, TUBE-J19. Save-Node rewind costs –2 RES or +1 Stress.

### Scene seed  

> *The ship shudders as a gravimetric shear slams the hull.  In Junction J-19 steam hisses from a ruptured conduit; crimson alert strobes wash the crawl-tube walls.  T’Lara’s tricorder whines—EPS flow spiking.  Ortiz wipes condensation from his brow, voice tight over comms.*  

> Options:  
> 1. Close the manual cutoff—risk flash-burn on a Muscle roll.  
> 2. Crawl deeper, hoping to reach the primary junction (Reflex).  
> 3. Bypass power through a jury-rigged phase inverter (Systems, Adv if you spend “Reroute!”).  

*—How will the lower decks save the upper bridge?*
