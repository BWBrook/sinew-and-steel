### How to use the Chinese Room

1. **Replace placeholders**  
   - `{{ SKIN NAME }}` – e.g., *Briar & Benedictine*, *Jeffries-Tube Blues*, etc.

2. **Paste** the core rules from `rules/core/` and the chosen skin from `skins/` under **Context**.

3. **Send** the entire `<start_prompt> … <end_prompt>` to ChatGPT or your chosen API model.

4. The AI will output a **public teaser** *and* a **private `[GM-NOTES zh]` block**.

5. **Copy** the `[GM-NOTES zh]` block back into the running conversation to keep it in context (if needed).

6. **Play!**  
   *(Players who translate the hidden Chinese only rob themselves; honest duet play preserves the mystery.)*

> *Happy delving—may your secrets stay cryptic until the final torch gutters out.*
