schema_version: 1

# Sinew & Steel — Skin Artwork Requests
#
# Purpose
# - A prompt-ready list of additional spot-art assets (and per-skin logos) to
#   improve visual appeal in `skins/*.md`.
# - All prompts assume the established house style: black-and-white pen-and-ink
#   spot illustrations that read clearly when printed small.
#
# Conventions
# - Filenames use `ss_` prefix and are suggested only (rename as you like).
# - "logo" assets are intended as small maker's marks near the top of each skin.
# - "spot_art" assets are intended for inline wrap (`.wrap-left/.wrap-right`)
#   near the named section.
