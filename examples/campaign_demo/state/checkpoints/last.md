The cave wolf is gone, blood dark on snow.

The birches click together in the wind, but beneath that you catch another rhythm: lighter steps, too neat for any beast. Whoever made them walked *without hurry*.

Ahead, the trees thin toward the frozen stream. In the dark, something taps bone against stone — once, then again — like a signal.

Options:
1. Follow the wolf’s blood toward the frozen stream (CUN).
2. Circle wide and try to spot the watcher before it spots you (FLT).
3. Call softly for Tarra and the clan (no roll).
