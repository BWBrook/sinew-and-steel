# Session 001
## GM

Snow needles the cave mouth. Tarra the Ember-Singer presses her palm to the stone and listens. Beyond the birches, something large exhales — slow, patient, hungry.

Options:
1. Wake the clan and bar the entrance.
2. Slip outside and follow the fresh tracks downwind.
3. Feed the fire with resin and call to the spirits.

## Player

2. Slip outside and follow the tracks downwind.

## System

Mechanics (example):
- MGT 12 → rolled 11 → success (margin +1)

Result: You keep your footing on wet stone and cold roots — quiet enough that the night does not look up.
