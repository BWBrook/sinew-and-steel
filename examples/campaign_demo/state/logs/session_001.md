# Session 001
## GM

Snow needles the cave mouth. The hearth is down to embers, smoke crawling low like it’s afraid to leave.

Beyond the birches, you hear a soft wet crunch — teeth on bone — and then a slow exhale, patient and hungry.

Options:
1. Slip out and read the tracks downwind (CUN).
2. Stalk the sound with spear ready (FLT).
3. Feed the fire and call to the spirits (SPR; fail = +1 Shadow).

## Player

2 and then 3.

## System

Mechanics (example combat beat):
- Grak attacks with MGT 12 → rolled 7 → success (margin +5)
- Cave wolf defends with FLT 10 → rolled 15 → fail (margin –5)
- Hit. Damage = 1 + edge(+1) − soak(0) = 2 → wolf STM 4 → 2
- Tarra attacks with SPR 14 → rolled 9 → success (margin +5)
- Cave wolf defends with FLT 10 → rolled 9 → success (margin +1)
- Both succeed; Tarra wins → consequence: the wolf breaks and flees (no further damage)

Result: Grak’s spear drives the wolf back bleeding; Tarra’s ember-chant turns fear into motion. It vanishes into the birch‑line, yelping.
