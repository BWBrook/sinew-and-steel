# Examples

These are small, non-canonical samples to show file formats and tool usage.

- examples/character_sheet.yaml
- examples/session_notes.md
- examples/command_snippets.md
- examples/campaign_demo/ (scaffolded campaign snapshot: `campaign.yaml`, `prompt.md`, and minimal `state/` files)

For real play, use `campaigns/<slug>/` (gitignored). The `examples/` folder is just a reference.
