# **CLANFIRE — EMBERFALL**
## A “play tonight” starter scenario for Sinew & Steel

**GM eyes only.** This is a short scenario designed to get a new table (or an AI Custodian) to a first satisfying scene, fast.

### In one sentence
The clan’s hearth is dying in a hard winter, and the hunt that should save you is already being claimed by hungry things in the birch‑line.

### Why Clanfire?
Clanfire is the simplest skin: it’s close to pure core play (roll‑under, margin, Luck, Stamina, Pressure), with only a light genre overlay.
If your group can run *this*, you can reskin Sinew & Steel to anything.

---

## 1) What you need (minimum kit)
- `rules/quickstart.md` (rules on two pages)
- `skins/clanfire.md` (skin rules + Shadow track)
- A d20 (or a trusted roll tool)
- Two PCs (recommended) or one PC (works fine)

---

## 2) Pre‑gen PCs (optional, but recommended)
If you want to start in 60 seconds, use these two example clansfolk (from the Clanfire skin):

### Grak of Tall Cliffs — Hunter
MGT 12 · FLT 11 · CUN 10 · SPR 8 · **INS 8/8** · **STM 7/7** · Shadow 0/5  
Stone spear (+1 edge), hand‑axe (+1 edge), hide cloak (soak 1), ochre pouch, sinew cord.

### Tarra the Ember‑Singer — Shaman
MGT 6 · FLT 8 · CUN 12 · SPR 14 · **INS 11/11** · **STM 3/3** · Shadow 0/5  
Carved bone flute (Adv calming beasts), fire‑bow drill, herb bundle, scrap of strange cloth.

If you only have one PC, run **Grak** solo and keep Tarra as an NPC ally.

---

## 3) Opening beat (read aloud or paraphrase)
The hearth is down to embers.
Frost beads on the cave mouth. Smoke crawls low and thin, as if it’s afraid to leave.

Outside, birch trunks click together in the wind — but beneath that is another sound:
**a soft, wet crunch**. Teeth on bone.

Somewhere beyond the birches, something large exhales — slow, patient, hungry.

### Offer 2–4 options (and accept freeform)
1. **Slip out and read the tracks** downwind (CUN).  
2. **Stalk the sound** with spear ready (FLT).  
3. **Feed the fire and call to the spirits** for an omen (SPR; on a fail, +1 Shadow).  
4. **Wake the clan** and bar the cave (no roll; but tick a clock: time passes).

---

## 4) The truth (keep this behind the screen)
This is not a “save the world” plot. It’s a tight survival problem with three pressures:

1. **Hunger:** the clan needs meat and fat before the next hard snow.
2. **Predators:** a **cave wolf** has learned the clan’s routine and is testing the edge of the light.
3. **Signs:** the wind carries a wrong note — something is *off* in the birch‑line (spirits restless, strangers near, or both).

Pick one twist to taste (or roll a d3):
1. **Rival hunters** are trailing the same quarry and will steal the kill if you hesitate.
2. **A spirit omen** is real: the prey is marked, and taking it demands a taboo cost.
3. **Strangers on the ridge**: distant watchers leave unnaturally clean footprints (not wolves).

---

## 5) Optional clocks (clean, story-facing)
Use clocks only if you want extra tension beyond Shadow.

- **Hunger (0/6):** ticks when time passes, you return empty‑handed, or you spend food.  
  - When full: the clan must migrate *now* (or someone is lost to starvation).
- **Storm (0/6):** ticks on loud actions, long travel, or a bad miss in the open.  
  - When full: whiteout. Visibility drops. Every risky test costs +1 INS bead *or* +1 Shadow (your choice).
- **Pack Learns (0/4):** ticks when wolves spot you, smell blood, or you leave a kill unattended.  
  - When full: the pack surrounds the cave at night (a Shadow spike scene).

---

## 6) Threats and NPCs (fast cards)

### Cave Wolf (Soldier 10; pack hunter)
- **Attack:** FLT 10 (pounce / bite) · **Edge +1**  
- **Defend:** FLT 10 (dodge / weave)  
- **Stamina:** 4 · **Soak:** 0  
- **Hook:** If the wolf wins an opposed roll by **margin ≥ 4**, it drags the target 2–3 metres toward darkness.

*(If you want it tougher, make it Elite 12 and give it STM 5.)*

### Old Hunter (NPC)
Wants: meat without risk.  
Tells: “The birch‑line is wrong. I have hunted here since my teeth were new.”  
Breaks: refuses to leave the cave if Shadow is 3+.

### Young Scout (NPC)
Wants: to prove worth.  
Tells: saw “eyes like wet stones” near the frozen stream.  
Breaks: bolts if a wolf is within arm’s reach.

### Rival Pair (NPC threat)
Wants: your kill.  
Tells: “We saw it first.”  
Breaks: if you shame them publicly, they return later with allies.

## 7) A combat example (Grak + Tarra vs a Cave Wolf)
Use this as a teaching exchange. It’s short, it shows the math, and it shows that “combat” can be “drive it off”.

### Setup
The cave wolf slips between birches at the edge of firelight, hackles raised.
It wants a meal, not a fair fight.

**Declare intent:** Grak wants to **drive it back**; Tarra wants to **break its nerve** with flame and chant.

### Beat 1 — Grak lunges (attack with Might)
- **Attacker:** Grak rolls under **MGT 12** (spear thrust, forceful drive).
- **Defender:** Wolf rolls under **FLT 10** (dodge).

Example rolls:
- Grak rolls **7** → success (margin **+5**).
- Wolf rolls **15** → fail (margin **–5**).

Result:
- Grak wins (only attacker succeeds).  
- Damage = `1 + edge (+1) − soak (0)` = **2** → wolf STM **4 → 2**.  
- Fiction: the spear doesn’t “skewer it clean”; it *cuts it* and forces it to give ground.

### Beat 2 — Tarra turns fire into a weapon (attack with Spirit)
Tarra’s method is not “stab”. It’s **presence, fear, omen**.

- **Attacker:** Tarra rolls under **SPR 14** (chant + ember‑flare).
- **Defender:** Wolf rolls under **SPR 8** (tier – 2: if you want a “fear check”), *or* keep it simple and defend with **FLT 10** (it tries to dart away from the flame).

Example (simple defense):
- Tarra rolls **9** → success (margin **+5**).
- Wolf darts with **FLT** and rolls **9** → success (margin **+1**).

Result:
- Both succeed; Tarra wins (higher margin).  
- Apply an agreed consequence instead of damage: **the wolf breaks and flees**, yelping.
- Optional rider: if Tarra rolled a **natural 1**, the pack does not return this night.

### What if they fail?
If Grak misses and Tarra’s chant falters:
- The wolf bites (edge +1) and retreats with stolen meat.  
- Tick **Hunger** or mark **+1 Shadow** (your choice).

## 8) Ending the first session (clean cliffhanger)
End on one clear unanswered question:
- “What’s making the birch‑line wrong?” (spirits? strangers? rival hunters?)

Close with 2–4 options for next session:
1. **Follow the wolf’s blood** toward the frozen stream (CUN).  
2. **Set a trap line** and retreat to the cave before the storm turns (CUN).  
3. **Perform a fire‑circle omen** and accept the cost (SPR; fail = +1 Shadow).  
4. **Wake the clan and migrate** before dawn (no roll; tick Hunger and Storm).
