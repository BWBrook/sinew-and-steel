## Custodian’s Almanac (GM Quick Guide)

### 1 The Custodian’s job (30 seconds)

![](../../assets/art/ss_decision_loop.png){.wrap-right width=1.7in trim="324bp 200bp 337bp 135bp"}

You do three things, on repeat:

1. **Frame the fiction** (concrete details, a hook, a pressure point).
2. **Ask for intent + method** (“What do you do, and how?”).
3. **Adjudicate** (no roll / roll‑under / opposed), then apply consequences.

The rules exist to support momentum. If you’re forcing dice every sentence, you’re doing it wrong.

---

### 2 When to roll (and when not to)

![](../../assets/art/ss_non_roll_outcomes.png){.wrap-left width=2.3in trim="167bp 410bp 168bp 384bp"}

Call for a roll only when:

- the outcome is **uncertain**, and
- the outcome **matters** (risk, time, reputation, resources, irreversible consequences).

If the player’s approach is plausible and failure would be boring, resolve it narratively.

**Good non‑roll outcomes:**

- **Yes, and…** (clean success with an extra advantage)
- **Yes, but…** (success with cost: time, noise, +1 Pressure, lost item)
- **No, but…** (failure with progress: you get in, but you’re spotted)

---

### 3 Luck tests (sheer fate)

![](../../assets/art/ss_luck_test.png){.wrap-right width=1.7in trim="338bp 235bp 301bp 167bp"}

Call for players to “Test your Luck!” when **no skill reasonably applies** or when pure chance decides:
rockfalls, blind picks, patrol timings, “did the guard step away for a second?”

Use sparingly — one or two Luck tests per dozen beats is plenty.

You can season recovery by fiction: a sacred rite adds +3 tokens; a night on Martian rad‑dust adds none.

---

### 4 Pressure track (Doom / Heat / Strain / Dread / Anomaly…) and Clocks (Countdowns)
A universal **0–5 fuse** shared by all skins. When it hits **5**, a crisis triggers — then it resets to **0**.

| Step         | Mood               | Custodian levers                             |
| ------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | Calm               | —                                            |
| 1            | Unease             | Cosmetic omens                               |
| 2            | Stirrings          | Minor Disadvantage, flicker tech             |
| 3            | Rumble             | Noticeable penalty, NPC mistrust             |
| 4            | Fracture           | Abilities cost +1 Luck, environment hostile  |
| 5 **Crisis** | Backlash / Paradox | Trigger crisis, then reset Pressure to **0** |

![](../../assets/art/ss_pressure_fuse.png){.wrap-right width=2.1in trim="276bp 420bp 245bp 243bp"}

**Earning & purging**

- Add **+1 Pressure** for: desperate bargains, taboo acts, noisy heroics, risky rituals, big blunders, time passing under threat.
- Remove points by: sacrifice, cleansing rites, story quests, cash burn, hard‑won safety.
- A crisis should be a **dramatic twist**, not a punishment; it resets the fuse so play keeps moving.

---

**Example (Pressure as a lever):**

> “*You can kick the door right now. It’ll work — but it’s loud. +1 Pressure.*”

---

**Clocks (Heat / Threat / countdowns)**

![](../../assets/art/ss_clocks.png){.wrap-right width=2.2in trim="405bp 293bp 359bp 241bp"}

Alongside Pressure, you may also run one or more **clocks**: named progress meters that track a specific looming outcome.

- A clock is usually **4–8 ticks** (but any size works).
- When a clock fills, **something happens** (“guards arrive,” “the storm closes the pass,” “the cult completes the rite,” “the ship jumps to red alert”).
- You can **tick** a clock when time passes, after failures, or when players stall — it’s a clean way to apply pressure without demanding a roll.
- Clocks can be **public** (“Reinforcements: 3/6”) or **hidden** (revealed only as signs and consequences).

**Pressure vs clocks**

- **Pressure** is universal, abstract, and short‑cycle: it hits 5, triggers a crisis, then resets to 0.
- **Clocks** are specific, story‑facing, and long‑cycle: they track one concrete danger or countdown and don’t reset unless you choose to reset them in the fiction.

---

### 5 Milestones & boons (progress without grind)

![](../../assets/art/ss_milestone_bonus.png){.wrap-right width=2.0in trim="288bp 343bp 287bp 290bp"}

Every 3–4 *perilous* beats or combat encounters, award:

- **+2 build points**, and
- **a narrative boon** (rare item, ally favour, mystic scar, access, safe refuge).

Boons don’t break the maths; they sit outside the economy. Progress is narrative, not numeric grind.

---

### 6 Moves when players stall

![](../../assets/art/ss_act_now.png){.wrap-left width=1.6in trim="380bp 251bp 354bp 183bp"}

If players stall, don’t demand a roll “to do something”. Move the world:

- advance a clock
- reveal an omen
- shift weather / lighting / terrain
- offer a harsh bargain
- introduce a threat with a visible timer

---

**Example (unstick play):**

> “*While you argue, the lantern sputters. If you don’t act, it goes out in one minute.*”

---

### 7 Optional plug‑ins (use only what you need)
- **Totem/Feat** — once per session gain Advantage at cost of 1 Luck or +1 Pressure.
- **Allies / Pets** — treat as a temporary 3‑token Luck pool that depletes on use.
- **Condition Tracks** — Fear, Radiation, Madness: extra 0–5 fuses like Pressure, but tied to one specific hazard. Use them only when you want a **second escalation axis** besides Pressure; otherwise use clocks.
- **Wealth & Attention** — optional 0–4 “money” track; big spends drop it; flashing wealth draws trouble.

---

### 8 Advice for AI game masters (optional)
If you’re running Sinew & Steel with an AI custodian:

- Write scenes in **2–5 paragraphs**, ending on tension or uncertainty.
- Offer **2–4 numbered options** (and allow freeform play, always).
- State **stakes before rolling** (what changes on success vs failure).
- Roll only for uncertainty + stakes — many beats are pure narrative.
- Record outcomes: what changed, what was spent, what clock ticked.

Dice neutrality matters. 

Use a method the table trusts (physical dice, a local tool, or a transparent roll function).
Always surface the result, margin, and any Luck‑spend offer.

## Part I Player insights (why the chassis works)

### A. Why five numbers?
Five attribute scores map cleanly onto the d20’s 20‑step granularity while keeping sheets readable.
A tight economy stops power creep yet still allows extremes to emerge.

### B. Burning Luck — when it matters
- **Save the day:** flip a miss into a glancing hit to avoid disaster.
- **Penetrate armour:** spend extra tokens after a success to deepen margin and shred soak.
- **Turn the plot:** burn your last 3 Luck on a vital opposed roll, knowing future Luck tests are now long shots.

> **Guideline:** a pool under 4 tokens means “walk gingerly”; under 2 means “pray for milestone”.

### C. Sample builds (baseline 10/5)
All obey the +1/‑2 ledger (attributes baseline 10; Stamina baseline 5).
These examples spend a mix of **6 build points** and stat trade‑offs; add starting build points to taste.

| Concept       | MGT    | REF | INT    | EMP    | LCK | STM |
| ------------- | ------ | --- | ------ | ------ | --- | --- |
| Scholar       | 7      | 10  | **14** | 10     | 11  | 4   |
| Iron Brute    | **15** | 7   | 6      | 7      | 10  | 8   |
| Silver‑tongue | 8      | 10  | **11** | **13** | 10  | 5   |

---

## Part II Optional modules & tables

### A. Tone dial — build‑point pool
At character creation you may gift each player build points to set tone:

- **0** for grim survival
- **6** for standard play (recommended default)
- **12** for pulpy competence
- **16** for heroic flair

(Or pick any number that fits your table.)

The pool lets heroes spike a signature strength or patch a weakness without repainting every stat.
It shifts capability while leaving core maths and pacing intact.

### B. Luck test frequency

> **Rule of thumb:** if you’ve called for Luck twice this session, reach for another lever before a third.

### C. Pressure colour suggestions
| Skin            | 1                | 2             | 3             | 4             | 5 (Crisis)        |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Sword & Sorcery | Whispered sigils | Blood moon    | Spirits stalk | Gates crack   | Demon walks       |
| Hard‑SF         | Static blips     | Sensor ghosts | Hull groans   | Reactor spike | Core breach       |
| Gothic Horror   | Chill wind       | Mirrors fog   | Whispers grow | Shadows move  | The Guest arrives |

### D. NPC / monster design (30‑second method)

![](../../assets/art/ss_npc_card.png){.wrap-right width=1.7in trim="380bp 266bp 380bp 251bp"}

1. **Pick threat tier (the number that matters):** *Peasant 8 | Soldier 10 | Elite 12 | Monster 14 | Nemesis 16*
   - This number is the NPC’s **tier score**: the roll‑under target for their main actions.
   - You can run simple NPCs with **one score** (use the tier score for most rolls).
   - If you want a little texture, give them a **strong/weak pair**:
     - one “best” attribute at **tier**
     - one “worst” attribute at **tier − 4**
     - treat anything else as **tier − 2** (or just improvise per fiction).
   - NPC stats may fall below player‑character creation floors; that’s fine — they’re not built on the same ledger.
2. **Assign stamina, edge & soak:**
   - Suggested **Stamina** by tier (human‑scale): Peasant 3, Soldier 4, Elite 5, Monster 6, Nemesis 7.
   - For **large beasts** add +2 Stamina; for a **boss** add +4 (or give them a second phase at 0).
   - Suggested weapon **edge**: Light +0 / Standard +1 / Brutal +2.
   - Suggested armour **soak**: Hide 1 / Shell 2 / Plate 3.
3. **Give a hook:** one special move or rule that makes them feel distinct (“mind‑spike forces Luck test,” “web‑snare: failed Reflex ⇒ immobile until cut free,” “howl: on nat 20 targets mark +1 Pressure”).

Examples:

- **Tunnel Brute (Elite 12)** — MGT 12, REF 8, STM 5; edge +1 club, soak 1 hide; on hit may drag victim 5 m into darkness.
- **Cave Bear (Monster 14, large)** — MGT 14, REF 8, STM 8; edge +2 maul, soak 1 thick fur; on attacker nat 1 bear counter‑swipes 1 STM.

### E. “Fatal” tag (one‑line universal override)

> **Fatal** — this harm **ignores Stamina and soak**; a struck target drops to 0 STM unless they possess the listed counter‑measure.

Use it sparingly, flag it clearly, and state the counter up front.

| Setting | Fatal weapon / event | Counter‑measure |
|---|---|---|
| **Service Duct Blues** | Rapid decompression | Sealed suit **or** an emergency bulkhead seal |
| **Iron & Ruin** | Basilisk gaze | Averting eyes behind a polished bronze mirror |
| **Clanfire** | Mammoth stampede crush | Spending 1 Luck (Clanfire: Instinct) **and** passing a Reflex/Fleetness roll to dive clear |
| **Candlelight Dungeons** | Assassin’s throat‑slit on sleeping victim | Staying conscious or wearing a gorget helmet while resting |

**How to apply**

1. Declare: **Fatal (counter: X)**.
2. If the target lacks the counter, they drop to **0 Stamina** immediately; normal collapse/death rules follow.
3. Counters can be equipment, a successful roll, or a resource spend — keep it explicit.

Why it works:

- cinematic stakes without new math
- a single tag plus a counter clause
- scales across genres without rewriting combat

### F. Advantage source list (example set)
- Solid cover (Dodge Adv.)
- Has the high ground (Melee Adv.)
- Blind firing (Ranged Dis.)
- Exhausted (Stamina ≤ 2 ⇒ Dis. on physical)

Add or prune per skin.

### G. Milestone boon bank (d6) — mixed examples
1. Trusted ally owes a favour
2. Rare gadget (+1 Adv. on one skill)
3. Mystic scar (+1 build point earmarked for your signature stat)
4. Hidden refuge grants full Luck reset mid‑adventure
5. Weapon gains +1 edge vs. one foe type
6. Vision of future — ask the custodian one yes/no about next session

### H. Conversion pointers
- **d100 games:** divide skill by 5 ≈ attribute
- **2d6+stat games:** (10 + stat) × 5 ≈ attribute chance
- **Old‑school AC:** treat armour class / 2 rounded as soak (leather 1… plate 3)

---

### I. Wealth & Attention (optional money subsystem)
By default, Sinew & Steel does not count coins, credits, or rations.
Money doesn’t take inventory slots — but it can still matter in play.

If you want money to have table‑weight without bookkeeping, track a single **Wealth** score per party or per character:

| Wealth | Name   | What it means (examples)                     |
| ------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | Broke  | scavenging, begging, barter only             |
| 1      | Poor   | basic food, cheap lodging, simple gear       |
| 2      | Steady | normal supplies, travel, common bribes       |
| 3      | Flush  | serious bribes, mounts, quality kit          |
| 4      | Rich   | rare goods, influence, attention magnets     |

![](../../assets/art/ss_money_trouble.png){.wrap-right width=2.0in trim="271bp 312bp 216bp 234bp"}

**How to use it**

- **Trivial costs:** ignore them.
- When a purchase matters, assign a **cost tier** (0–4).
  - If Wealth is **≥ tier**, they can afford it.
  - If it’s a meaningful spend, **reduce Wealth by 1** (don’t do this for every meal).
- If Wealth is **below tier**, roll **LCK**:
  - **Success:** they scrape it together — but Wealth drops by 1 *or* they take a complication (debt, favour owed, suspicious seller).
  - **Failure:** they can’t afford it — or they can only afford it by paying a hard cost (Debt clock, +Pressure, dangerous favour).

**Attention rule (turn riches into story):**
When Wealth is **3+** and they flash it in public (big bribes, rare purchases, loud luxury), expect consequences:

- tick **Pressure** (+1), **or**
- start/tick a **Heat/Threat** clock.

Rename Wealth per skin (Coin / Dollars / Credits / Supplies / Influence / Cargo Scrip) without changing the procedure.
