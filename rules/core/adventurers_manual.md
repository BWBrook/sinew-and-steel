# **SINEW & STEEL — ADVENTURER’S MANUAL**

A razor‑lean, setting‑agnostic chassis for any genre. One d20, five attribute scores, limitless skins.

In Sinew & Steel, a **skin** is a small genre overlay that renames the attributes, defines what fortune and fate represent, names your Pressure track, and adds a few custom rules.

For the two‑page version, see `rules/quickstart.md`.

## 1 The Core Rule

![](../../assets/art/ss_roll_under.png){.wrap-right width=1.6in}

Roll **one d20**. If the result is **≤ your attribute**, you succeed; if it’s higher, you fail.

### 1.1 Natural results
- **Natural 1** — legendary success.
- **Natural 20** — disastrous failure.

### 1.2 Margin (how well / how badly)
**Margin** = `attribute − roll`.
- Positive margin means you succeed with room to spare.
- Negative margin means you fail (and how far off you were).

### 1.3 Advantage / Disadvantage
- **Advantage:** roll 2d20, keep the **lower**.
- **Disadvantage:** roll 2d20, keep the **higher**.

### 1.4 Opposed rolls
Both sides roll under their relevant attribute.

- If only one side succeeds, that side wins.
- If both succeed, compare **margins**. Higher margin wins.
- **Ties favour the defender.**
- If both fail, the defender wins (you don’t “accidentally succeed”).

### 1.5 When to roll
Roll only when **the outcome is uncertain** *and* **it matters**.
If failure would be boring, resolve it narratively.

**Micro‑example (the table loop):**

> Custodian: “The rope bridge is slick with ice. What do you do?”  
> Player: “I go slow, testing each plank, and keep low.”  
> Custodian: “That’s careful. Roll under REF with Advantage. On a fail you still cross, but you lose time and the Pressure clock ticks.”

## 2 Building a Hero (player character)

### 2.1 Start from the baseline frame

![](../../assets/art/ss_baseline_character_frame.png){.wrap-right width=1.9in}

Every character begins at:
- **Five attributes at 10** (skins rename these to fit genre).
- **Stamina 5** (STM: your health).

Legal ranges at creation:
- Attributes: **6–16**
- Stamina: **3–9**

_Abbreviation note: PC = player character, NPC = non-player character_

### 2.1.1 What the five attributes mean (default names)
Skins rename and re‑flavour attributes, but the core game assumes five broad domains.
If you need a default set (and for examples in this manual), use:

- **MGT — Might:** strength, endurance, force, brutality.
- **REF — Reflex:** speed, coordination, balance, stealth, aim.
- **INT — Intellect:** knowledge, planning, perception, systems.
- **EMP — Empathy:** social sense, willpower, leadership, composure.
- **LCK — Luck:** tokens you spend to nudge fate (and roll under when sheer chance decides).

### 2.2 The point‑buy economy (trade-offs and build points)

![](../../assets/art/ss_points_buy_economy.png){.wrap-right width=1.55in}

You can customize your stats using the same economy in two equivalent ways:

**A) Trade‑offs (the “double‑debit” ledger):**  
Every **+1** you push **above baseline** must be “paid for” by **‑2 total** below baseline across other scores.

**B) Build points (the tone dial):**  
Build points let you raise stats without taking as many trade‑offs.

You can mix these: take some trade‑offs, spend some build points; they’re two ways of paying into the same economy.

Cost model (same for attributes and Stamina):
- If the score is **at/above baseline**, **+1 costs 2 build points**.
- If the score is **below baseline**, **+1 costs 1 build point** (to climb back toward baseline).

Baseline notes:
- Attributes baseline at **10**.
- Stamina baseline at **5**.

> *Bump a stat up? Either pay double elsewhere… or pay build points.*

### 2.3 Starting build points (recommended default)
At creation, the Custodian chooses a starting budget for tone:
- **0** (grim survival)
- **6** (standard; recommended default)
- **12** (pulp competence)
- **16** (heroic flair)

### 2.4 Step‑by‑step creation (fast, reliable)
1. Pick a skin (it names your five attributes and your Pressure track colour).
2. Write the baseline frame: five 10s, Stamina 5.
3. Choose one “signature” strength and raise it.
4. Either:
   - take matching trade‑offs (‑2 total per +1 above baseline), **or**
   - spend build points to avoid (some of) those reductions.
5. Set your **Luck pool**: your skin tells you which attribute is Luck.
6. Write 3–6 items of gear and one small advantage (if your table uses them).

### 2.5 Worked example (build points + trade‑offs)
You want a sharp‑witted PC hero and you raise INT from 10 to 13 (**+3 above baseline**).

- Trade‑off version: you must take **‑6 total** across other scores (no build points required).
- Build‑point version: you can instead spend **6 build points** (2 per +1 above baseline) and keep the rest closer to baseline.

## 3 Luck Pool (tokens)

![](../../assets/art/ss_luck_pool.png){.wrap-left width=1.7in}

Your **Luck score** *is* your token pool.
If your skin says “Hope” or “Fortune” or “Resourcefulness,” that score is still Luck mechanically.

Luck pulls double duty: it’s a pool you spend to bend results, and it’s the score you roll under when sheer chance decides.
Spend for the moment, but remember you’ll feel it in the future, when the Custodian asks you to “Test your Luck!”.

> *The more you bend fate now, the shakier your later odds.*

- After you see a roll, spend any number of tokens to **nudge** the die **±1 per token**.
  - **Natural 1 and 20 are locked** (cannot be nudged).
- Luck tests roll **≤ your current tokens** (not your maximum).
- A short rest restores **+1 token**.
- At a milestone, you refill back up to your Luck score (your max).

Combat note:

> You may spend Luck after a successful attack to deepen your margin and chew through armour soak.

---

## 4 Stamina (Health) & Recovery

- **Damage reduces Stamina.**
- Typical weapons add **edge**: +0 / +1 / +2.
- At **0 Stamina**, you collapse (what that means is fiction‑dependent).
- Short rest: **+1 Stamina** (up to your max).
- Good care: **+2 Stamina** (up to your max).

Stamina isn’t a promise of immortality: falls, fire, vacuum, and guillotines can be instantly fatal.
The Custodian may warn you when the fiction implies lethal stakes beyond a normal wound.

---

## 5 Taking Action

### 5.1 Simple tests
Roll under the relevant attribute, or test your luck. Advantage / Disadvantage as fiction dictates.

### 5.2 Opposed tests
Both roll. If only one succeeds, that side wins. If both succeed, compare margins; higher wins; ties defend.

---

## 6 Combat

![](../../assets/art/ss_combat_sequence.png){.wrap-right width=1.9in}

1. **Attacker** rolls under the attribute that matches how they attack.
   - **Heavy / forceful** (wrestle, smash, cleave): usually **MGT**.
   - **Fast / precise** (finesse, archery, thrown weapons): usually **REF**.
   - **Clever / technical** (aiming for a weak point, gadgets, “spells”): usually **INT**.
   - **Presence / nerve** (taunt, command, distract, intimidate): sometimes **EMP**.
   - **Lucky break** (pull off a trick shot, trigger an environmental cascade): rarely **LCK**.
2. **Defender** rolls under the attribute that matches how they defend.
   - **Dodge** (get out of the way): usually **REF**.
   - **Parry / brace** (meet force with force): usually **MGT**.
   - **Cover / positioning** (angles, terrain, timing): usually **INT**.
   - **Luck** (sheer chance — a ricochet, a misfire, a loose plank): sometimes **LCK**.
   - **Composure / resolve** (keep your head, accept a surrender, resist intimidation): sometimes **EMP**.

   If there’s no plausible defense (surprised, pinned, helpless), the Custodian can skip the defense roll — or call for Luck if fate alone might spare you.
3. On a hit: damage = **1 + weapon edge − effective soak**.
4. **Natural 1** or **margin ≥ 10** adds **+1 damage**.
   If your goal isn’t harm (disarm, drive off, talk down), use the same opposed roll — but apply the agreed consequence instead of damage.

**Tiny examples (conflict without extra rules):**

> One‑in‑a‑million: you fire a last‑ditch ricochet shot (attack with **LCK**) to sever a hanging rope. On success, the portcullis drops; on failure, it stays up and Pressure rises.
> Talk‑down: you step in hard and command a surrender (attack with **EMP**) while your ally keeps their blade ready (threat in the fiction). On success, they back down; on failure, they lash out or call reinforcements.

### 6.1 Weapon edges (suggested)
- Improvised club **+0**
- Blade / spear / handgun **+1**
- Great‑axe / rifle / plasma **+2**

### 6.2 Armour & dynamic soak
| Armour                   | Base soak |
| ------------------------ | --------: |
| Hide / leather           |        1 |
| Mail / kevlar            |        2 |
| Plate / powered carapace |        3 |

After a hit:
- Reduce soak by **1 for every full 4 points of attacker margin** (round down).
- Any remaining soak reduces damage normally.
- **Natural 1 ignores all soak.**

**Micro‑example (soak erosion):**

> You hit with an NPC guard with margin +9 against soak 2.  
> Full 4s = 2 → soak drops by 2 (to 0).  
> The armour is shredded at the penetration point; this hit takes full damage.

## 7 Carry Limit

![](../../assets/art/ss_item_carry_limit.png){.wrap-right width=1.7in}

Six substantial items ride comfortably; more invites Disadvantage on agility tasks.
Tiny trinkets are free.

Money does not count against carry limit. By default it’s tracked loosely in the fiction — but if your table wants it tangible, use the optional **Wealth (0–4)** track (see the Custodian’s Almanac).

---

## 8 Pressure & Milestones (the pacing tools)

![](../../assets/art/ss_pressure_fuse.png){.wrap-left width=2.2in}

Every skin uses a shared **Pressure track (0–5)**, renamed to fit genre (Doom, Fatigue, Sin, Heat, Stress, Strain, Dread, Insanity, Anomaly…).
Pressure is the fuse: it rises with risk, blunders, bargains, and time pressure.

- When Pressure hits **5**, a **crisis** triggers — then Pressure **resets to 0**.
- Milestones happen every 3–4 *perilous* beats:
  - **+2 build points**
  - and a narrative boon (ally, relic, favour, scar, access)
