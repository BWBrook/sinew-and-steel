# **SINEW & STEEL — QUICKSTART (RULES ON TWO PAGES)**
*Everything else is story-fuel.*

**If you remember nothing else:** roll under, margin matters, Luck nudges, Pressure is the fuse.

## 1 Core Engine (60‑second digest)

- **Roll‑under d20.** If `d20 ≤ attribute`, you succeed; otherwise you fail.
  - **Natural 1** = legendary success | **Natural 20** = catastrophic failure.
- **Margin** = `attribute − roll` (positive = how well; negative = how badly).
- **Advantage / Disadvantage.** Roll 2d20; keep the lower / higher.
- **Opposed.** Both roll.
  - If only one succeeds, that side wins.
  - If both succeed, compare **margins**; higher margin wins; **ties favour the defender**.
  - If both fail, **the defender wins** (you don’t “accidentally succeed”).
- **Scores (creation).** Start from the baseline frame:
  - Five attributes at **10** (range **6–16**).
  - **Stamina 5** (range **3–9**).
  - Standard creation gives **6 build points** (grim 0 / pulp 12 / heroic 16).
    - **+1 above baseline costs 2 build points** (or “pay” by taking **‑2 total** below baseline elsewhere).
    - **+1 below baseline costs 1 build point** (to climb back toward baseline).
  - Default attributes (used in examples; skins rename these):
    - **MGT** — Might (strength, endurance, force)
    - **REF** — Reflex (speed, coordination, stealth)
    - **INT** — Intellect (knowledge, planning, systems)
    - **EMP** — Empathy (social sense, resolve, rapport)
    - **LCK** — Luck (tokens; also used when pure fate decides)
- **Stamina (health).** Damage reduces Stamina. At **0 STM** you collapse.
  - Typical weapons add **edge**: 0 / +1 / +2.
  - Recovery: short rest +1 STM; good care +2 (never above max).
- **Luck pool (tokens).** Your Luck score *is* your token count.
  - Luck is also the score you roll under when sheer chance decides; spending tokens makes later Luck rolls harder.
  - Spend tokens after a roll to **nudge** the die ±1 per token (**nat 1/20 are locked**).
  - Luck tests roll under **current** tokens.
  - Rest +1 token; milestone refills up to your Luck score (your max).
- **Armour & dynamic soak.** Armour has **soak 1–3**.
  - After a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points of attacker margin**; **nat 1 pierces all**.
- **Carry limit.** Up to **6 big items**; extra load ⇒ Disadvantage on agility tasks (your Reflex / Fleetness‑type rolls).
- **Money.** Usually abstract; if you want it tangible, use the optional **Wealth (0–4)** track (see the Custodian’s Almanac).
- **Pressure track (0–5).** Skin defines its name and crisis.
  - When Pressure hits **5**, trigger a crisis, then reset to **0**.

**Example (check + nudge):**
- REF 12, you roll **15** → fail (margin **–3**).
- Spend **3 Luck** to nudge **15 → 12** → success (margin **0**).

**Example (opposed):**
- Attacker MGT 12 rolls **8** (margin **+4**).
- Defender REF 10 rolls **9** (margin **+1**).
- Both succeed; attacker wins (higher margin).

## 2 Skins (swap flavour, rename stats, recolour Pressure)

Pick a skin to set tone and tweak rules. A skin tells you:
- what the five attributes are called,
- which attribute is your **Luck** score (token pool),
- what **Pressure** represents and what happens at 5.

Example skin genres (see `/skins/` for the full list):
- Ice‑Age survival — **Shadow** track; totems and beast bonds.
- Pulp sword‑and‑sorcery — **Doom** track; bargains and bad magic.
- Chrononautics — **Anomaly** crises; epoch mapping.
- Medieval monastic mystery — **Sin** track; penance and providence.
- Red‑planet noir — **Heat** track; pressure, dust, hard choices.
- Classic dungeon crawl — **Fatigue** track; torchlight and spell backlash.
- Lower‑decks starship drama — **Stress** track; emergency fixes under scrutiny.
- Cosmic horror — **Insanity** track; fragile hope and occult terror.
- Trader‑crew starfreight — **Strain** track; cargo, debt, patron jobs.
- Wanderer road‑fantasy — **Dread** track; fading hope and subtle rites.

> *To build your own skin:* rename stats, recolour Pressure, add 1–2 strict mechanical rules.

## 3 Custodian Quick‑Start (run a first session tonight)

1. **Frame the scene** in concrete details. End on a hook.
2. Ask: **“What do you do?”** Then listen for intent + method.
3. Decide resolution:
   - **No roll** if it’s plausible and uninteresting to fail.
   - **Roll‑under** if uncertainty + stakes demand it.
   - **Opposed** if someone actively resists.
4. If rolling, say the **stakes first**: what changes on success vs failure.
5. Give **2–4 options** when players hesitate; **at least one should be narrative** (no roll, just a trade‑off).
6. **Offer a Luck nudge** when failure is close and it would be fun to “pay for the win.”
7. **Advance Pressure** on big blunders, dark bargains, noisy heroics, time passing.
8. **Milestone** every 3–4 perilous beats: **+2 build points** + a narrative boon.
9. If play stalls: advance a clock, change the weather, introduce a hard bargain, or reveal a threat.
