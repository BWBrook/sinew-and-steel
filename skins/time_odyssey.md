# **TIME ODYSSEY**
## Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*Victorian chrononautics in the spirit of scientific romance and strange futures.*

_(Paste atop the Sinew & Steel rules; anything not listed here follows the core.)_

Time Odyssey is a scientific romance skin: brass and ivory wonder, distant epochs, and the chill realisation that history does not care who you are.
Expect hard choices, strange futures, and consequences that ripple across centuries.

Suggested creation tone: **pulp** (**12** build points) suits daring chrononautics well.

## CHRONONAUT'S CODEX (Adventurer)
*A skin for excursions across the centuries*

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Time Odyssey label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Prowess (PRW)** | grit, melee, heavy labour |
| Reflex | **Reflex (REF)** | agility, evasive footwork, sleight |
| Intellect | **Intellect (INT)** | science, deduction, engineering |
| Empathy | **Empathy (EMP)** | persuasion, morale, reading motives |
| Luck | **Ingenuity (ING)** | lateral insight **&** token pool |

### Ingenuity Pool flavour
Tokens are brass cogs.

When the Custodian calls for pure chance — “**Test your Ingenuity**!” — roll under your **current tokens**.
A short rest restores **+1 token**; paradoxical boons or esoteric rejuvenators may restore more.

**Rules reminder:** natural **1** is best; natural **20** is worst (and cannot be nudged).

### Weapons & Edges (typical era)
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Walking cane, punch | 0 |
| Cavalry sabre, pocket revolver | +1 |
| Arc‑rifle, pneumatic hammer | +2 |

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Tweed Coat | 0 |
| Leather riding jacket | 1 |
| Experimental alloy breastplate | 2 |

(Dynamic soak: after a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points** of attacker margin; **nat 1 pierces all**.)

### Temporal Anomaly (Pressure skin)
Meddling with history courts paradox.

Call for a Test when the outcome is uncertain and the stakes are historical: altering major events, meeting one’s past self, operating the machine under duress, or defying a fixed point.

- **Test INT** (reason, calculations) or **Test ING** (lateral insight, luck).
- On failure, mark **+1 Anomaly**.
- At **5**, trigger a crisis from the table — then reset Anomaly to **0**.

#### Crisis Table (d6) or choose
1 Memory fracture — forget the last scene until reminded  
2 Equipment sublimates — key item vanishes in glitter  
3 Rip current — party hurled d10×1000 years off‑target  
4 Temporal echo — hostile duplicate of PC appears  
5 Reality blur — Disadvantage on all rolls next session  
6 Roll twice; apply both

### Equipment & Burden nuance
Six big items; your brass‑and‑crystal chronal engine is always off‑screen. Currency shifts by era—bulky coinage invites thieves or customs scrutiny.

### Advancement Boon Seeds
After surviving a paradox cascade, cataloguing a prehistoric beast or shaping an epochal alliance, a **Milestone** and Boon might be awarded.  
Future‑alloy blade (+1 edge) • Patent rights (wealth advantage) • Eocene amber sample (sell it: restore **+3 Ingenuity tokens**, up to max) • Sphinx guardian favour (Adv once on EMP).

> *Ink these strictures upon vellum or etch them on a pocket brass plate—chrononauts who ignore them soon vanish into contradictory echoes.*

## CUSTODIAN MANUAL (Custodian)
*A guide for stewards of paradox, peril and Edwardian wonder*

### Narrative Tone
Brisk reportage, lyrical awe, with undercurrent of unease. Mix brass rivets and cosmic foreboding: “Ultramarine suns shimmered over a crystal sea as the machine’s valves hissed with protest.”

**Micro‑vignette (frame a beat):**
> The lever shudders. The needles climb. Outside the frosted glass, the world turns—too fast, too smooth—until the sky is the wrong colour.

Present 2-4 options in second‑person imperative, focused on protagonist. Include at least one hidden or risky path. Example:  
> 1. Descend into the ventilator shaft.  
> 2. Retreat to the machine and recalibrate era coils.  
> 3. Trust the pale child’s silent gesture.  

Ensure consequences ripple across epochs—saving a single flower in a far‑future garden may cure a Victorian cholera outbreak.  
Wrap the boon in story: a strange crystal implant grants **Advantage on one INT test per session**; a companion’s unwavering faith grants **one EMP reroll** (once).

### Custodian moves
Under‑tunnel ambush · Temporal storm blocks return · Rival chrononaut stakes claim · Faustian bargain: erase plague, gain +1 Anomaly.

### Luck (Ingenuity) Guidance
Call for a **Test of Ingenuity** when blind chance or hidden quantum decides: which epoch‑rift opens, whether a stray bullet hits the machine.
Keep it to 1–2 per session.

### Epoch Graph
Track beats and parallel timelines with chronological tags (1890A, 9000B, 2MyrC…).
Reward good record‑keeping: if players consult journals, maps, or diagrams, grant **Advantage** on INT/ING rolls to reconcile contradictions.

In this genre, the timeline doesn’t rewind — paradox is paid for in scars, loss, and **Anomaly**.

> *Chrononauts are needles in the fabric of time; you, Custodian, are the hand that stitches and snips. Keep the thread taut.*
