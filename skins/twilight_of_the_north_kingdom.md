# **TWILIGHT OF THE NORTH‑KINGDOM**
## Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*Eriador, late Third Age (T.A. 2950–3000). The Dúnedain keep lonely watch, shadows gather in forgotten barrows, and humble folk cherish hearth‑fires against the returning dark.*

_(Paste atop the Sinew & Steel rules; anything not listed here follows the core.)_

Twilight of the North‑Kingdom is Tolkien‑embedded wanderer adventure: long roads, hard choices, and small lights carried through large darkness.
Expect journeys, councils, songs in the cold, and moments where the Enemy is fought as much in the heart as with the sword.

Suggested creation tone: **heroic** (**16** build points).

In this skin, the Custodian is often called the **Loremaster**.

**Micro‑vignette (cold open):**
> The Greenway lies empty. The wind smells of rain and old stone. Somewhere beyond the next rise, a black bird cries — and the sound echoes like a question.

## 🌄 WANDERER’S ADD‑ON (Adventurer)

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Northern label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Strength (STR)** | brawn, climbing ruins, orc‑hewing |
| Reflex | **Nimbleness (NIM)** | stealth, archery, pony‑handling |
| Intellect | **Wisdom (WIS)** | lore, riddles, subtle craft, Elvish song |
| Empathy | **Heart (HRT)** | courage, persuasion, resisting dread |
| Luck | **Hope (HOP)** | fate‑tokens **and** inner light |

**Rules reminder:** natural **1** is best; natural **20** is worst (and cannot be nudged).

### Hope (Luck) tokens
Hope (HOP) is both a stat and a pool. Write it as **HOP current/max**.

When the Loremaster calls for blind chance — “**Test your Hope**!” — roll under your **current Hope** (not your maximum).
Spend Hope now to nudge rolls, but remember: fewer tokens means shakier Hope later.

A short rest by a safe fire restores **+1 Hope token**; an Elven haven or a true season of peace may restore more.

> “Mist pooled in the knife‑cuts of the hills, silver in moon’s waning glow.”

### Fellowship pool (shared nudges only)
Fellowship is a shared reserve the company leans on when one heart falters.

- Start with **1 Fellowship token per PC** (maximum = number of PCs).
- **Once per scene, each PC may spend 1 token from Fellowship** instead of spending their own Hope to **nudge a roll**.
- Fellowship tokens may be used **only** to nudge rolls (not to pay knack costs, rite costs, or other expenses).
- When the pool reaches **0**, each PC immediately **marks +1 Shadow**.

_(Harness note: this works cleanly as a campaign clock with `current/max`.)_

### Cultural Knacks (pick one)
Each use costs: **spend 1 Hope token** or **mark +1 Shadow**.  
(You cannot pay this cost with Fellowship; it must be personal.)

| Culture | Knack | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Hobbit** | *Small & Quiet* | Once per scene, automatically succeed on a NIM stealth test against Big‑folk watchers. |
| **Ranger** | *Keen Eyes* | Once per scene, gain Advantage on one WIS scan in a wild place. |
| **Dwarf** | *Stout‑Heart* | Once per session, ignore an incoming +1 Shadow mark you would take (fear, taint, betrayal). |
| **Elf** | *Starlit Memory* | Once per scene, ask the Loremaster one yes/no lore truth about your current situation. |
| **Bree‑lander** | *Plain Speech* | Once per scene, gain Advantage on one HRT test to barter, gossip, or calm folk in a settlement. |

### Weapons & Edges
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Dagger, sling‑stone | 0 |
| Sword, spear, short bow | +1 |
| Great spear, longbow, Dwarf‑axe | +2 |

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Leather jerkin | 0 |
| Riveted mail | 1 |
| Hauberk & shield | 2 |

(Dynamic soak: after a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points** of attacker margin; **nat 1 pierces all**.)

*Fatal tag (example):* troll club **Fatal (counter: heavy shield or dodge with Advantage)**.

## 📜 SUBTLE MAGIC — Elvish Rites

Rites do not hurl fire. They kindle courage, veil footsteps, and turn the will — softly, rarely, and with a price.

| Tier | Cast with | On success | On failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Whisper** | WIS | none | none |
| **Rite** | WIS | choose: spend **1 Hope** *or* mark **+1 Shadow** | mark **+1 Shadow** |
| **Invocation** | WIS *(no nudging)* | mark **+1 Shadow** | mark **+2 Shadow** and Loremaster backlash |
| **Unspeakable** | mark **+2 Shadow**, then roll | cost stands | **Break** (bout of despair) |

**No nudging (Invocation):** you may not spend Hope or Fellowship to nudge this roll.

**Loremaster backlash (examples):** a cold wind answers; a wight’s attention turns your way; an oath‑mark burns; a black bird follows for days.

**Break (bout of despair):** for the rest of the scene, you cannot spend Hope or Fellowship to nudge rolls, and the Loremaster chooses (or offers you) an impulse: flee, freeze, lash out, or fall into grief.

Examples: *Kindle Hearth‑Fire* (Rite), *Silence the Footfall* (Whisper), *Banish a Barrow‑Wight* (Invocation).

## 😓 FATIGUE — Journeys (per‑character track)

Fatigue measures road‑wear: wet boots, empty bellies, and too many miles under a hostile sky.

Track Fatigue per character: **0–5**.

**Each leg of a trek** (longer than a day) calls for one test chosen by the Guide:  
STR (rugged climb) • NIM (river ford) • WIS (navigation among ruins) • HRT (lead weary companions)

- **Failure:** mark **+1 Fatigue** (for the character who failed; or for everyone, if the whole party blundered).
- **At Fatigue 3+:** each **risky test during the journey** costs **1 Hope token** (spend before rolling) or marks **+1 Fatigue**.
- **At Fatigue 5:** you are **spent**. You cannot take another journey leg until you rest in true comfort; the Loremaster makes a hard travel move (separation, injury, pursuit, lost time).

**Clear Fatigue:** a night in true comfort clears all Fatigue; a warm campfire and dry socks clear 1.

**Song of Rest:** if a PC leads a song/story and passes **HRT**, each party member may either recover **+1 Hope token** or clear **1 Fatigue**.

> “Cold stars mirrored on the barrow’s stones, yet none were as cold as the hush within.”

## 🌓 SHADOW TRACK (Pressure)

Shadow is temptation, dread, and the slow creep of despair. It runs **0–5**; at **5** trigger a crisis, then reset Shadow to **0**.

| Step | Sign | Effect |
|--|--|--|
| 0 | Bright spirit | — |
| 1 | Gloom | cosmetic foreboding |
| 2 | Weight of worry | Disadvantage on your next HRT test vs dread |
| 3 | Dark whispers | Each **risky test** costs **1 Hope token** (spend before rolling) or marks **+1 Shadow** |
| 4 | Twisted will | Disadvantage on all tests |
| 5 **Crisis** | Corruption, despair, or the Enemy’s hand | Roll Shadow Crisis; reset Shadow to **0** |

_(A risky test is any roll where failure would materially change the situation: harm, loss, exposure, separation, betrayal. Routine talk and obvious chores need no roll.)_

**Gain Shadow:** witnessing true evil, oath‑breaking, tainted ground, hoarding while others starve, failing Invocations, spending Fellowship down to 0.

**Purge (rare):** set Shadow to **0** after a true cleansing scene — song in an Elven haven, a grave confession to a wise mentor, or a gift freely given that costs you something.

**Shadow Crisis (pick or roll d6)**  
1 Sudden greed — the company loses **1 Fellowship token** (if any remain)  
2 Black despair — you are helpless for one scene (you may only defend or speak)  
3 Shadow‑tongue — Disadvantage on your next social test this session  
4 Hope gutters — set your Hope to **0** (current only; max unchanged)  
5 Doom‑mark — foes sense you; the next dangerous encounter begins at Disadvantage  
6 Roll twice; apply both

## 📖 LOREMASTER’S CHRONICLE (Custodian)

_(If you prefer One‑Ring phrasing: “Custodian” = “Loremaster” for this skin.)_

### Journey Roles (micro‑TOR)
Assign up to three roles on any trek longer than a day.

| Role | Test each leg | On success | On failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Guide** (navigates) | WIS | stay on course | each PC marks **+1 Fatigue** |
| **Scout** (finds camps) | NIM | safe campsite; one PC clears **1 Fatigue** | random hazard encounter |
| **Look‑out** (watches) | HRT | early warning (Advantage first roll next encounter) | ambush; foes gain Advantage |

If a role is unfilled, treat the test as an auto‑fail.

### Councils & Entreaties
When the company must sway Elrond, Butterbur, or a dwarven lord:

- Set a **Council threshold** (3 for a petty lord, 5 for Elrond‑tier).
- Each speaking PC rolls **HRT** once:
  - success = **+1**
  - failure = **+0**
  - natural **1** = **+2**
  - natural **20** = **−1**
- PCs may spend Hope to nudge rolls as usual; Fellowship tokens may also be spent **only** for nudging.
- If the company reaches the threshold: favour granted. If not: partial help, conditions, or refusal.

### Optional combat module (micro‑TOR): Stances & Piercing Blows
Use this only if you want a little One‑Ring texture in combat without leaving the Sinew & Steel chassis.
It adds two ideas:

- **Endurance** = Stamina loss (ordinary hits wear you down).
- **Wounds** = rare, lingering injuries (a “piercing blow” that gets through).

#### Combat stances (choose each exchange)
At the start of each combat exchange (or “round”), each PC chooses a stance:

| Stance | Attack | Defence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Forward** | Advantage | Disadvantage | Bold, exposed. You cannot take this stance while **Wounded**. |
| **Open** | — | — | Balanced. |
| **Defensive** | Disadvantage | Advantage | Cautious; shield‑high, eyes up. |
| **Rearward** | ranged only (Advantage) | — | You fight from behind the line. If you are engaged in melee, your defence is at Disadvantage unless an ally screens you. |

_(Defence is the defender’s opposed roll: usually NIM to dodge/cover, STR to parry with shield/weapon, or HRT to stand firm against fear‑driven threats — as fits the fiction.)_

#### Piercing blows → Wounds
When you score a hit, first apply the normal Stamina loss and soak rules.

Then check for a **piercing blow**:
- Always: the attacker rolled a natural **1** on the attack test.
- Optional (grittier): the hit lands with **effective margin 8+**.

**Effective margin:** if both sides succeeded, it’s *(attacker margin − defender margin)*. If the defender failed, it’s simply *(attacker margin)*.

On a piercing blow, the target makes a **Protection test**:
- Roll d20 under **Protection = 10 + (Soak × 2)**.
- You may spend Hope (or Fellowship, if available) to nudge as normal.

If you **fail**, you gain the condition **Wounded**.

**Wounded (condition):**
- Record it as a note on your sheet (e.g., `Wounded: gash to the thigh`).
- While Wounded: Disadvantage on **STR** and **NIM** tests, and you cannot take **Forward** stance.
- If you are Wounded and you gain another Wound: you drop to **0 Stamina** immediately (taken out). Whether you die, are carried off, or are saved becomes the scene’s stake.

**Healing Wounds (slow):** a Wound does not clear on a short rest. It clears after a Fellowship Phase **Healing Rest** undertaking, or after a true sanctuary recovery (Elven healing, long rest in safety, Rivendell‑tier care).

### Fellowship Phase (downtime undertakings)
After a completed adventure, each PC picks **one** undertaking:

| Undertaking | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Healing Rest** | Clear all Fatigue and recover **+1 Hope token** |
| **Research Lore** | Ask the Loremaster one lore question; if it touches the Shadow, mark **+1 Shadow** |
| **Craft / Repair** | For the next adventure, one weapon/tool gains **+1 edge** (does not stack; cap edge at **+2**) |
| **Strengthen Bonds** | Restore **+1 Fellowship token** (up to the starting maximum) |

### Tainted & Hallowed Ground
- **Tainted** (old battlefield, barrow): each night spent here → mark **+1 Shadow**.
- **Hallowed** (Elven haven, Rivendell): the first full night clears **1 Shadow** and **1 Fatigue** for each PC.

Travel choices acquire moral weight.

## ✍️ WRITING IN TOLKIEN STYLE

- **Elevate but stay clear.** Plain words, with occasional high diction (“ere”, “fell”, “lo”).
- **Landscape as character.** Heather, hush of pines, stars wheeling above Amon Sûl.
- **Hope amid sorrow.** Even bleak moments hold a glimmer: thrush‑song, warm bread, a shared jest.
- **Songs & lineage.** A couplet; a remembered name (“son of Arvegil”).
- **Eucatastrophe.** Peril reaches darkest pitch, then a sudden turn — dawnlight, a horn, unexpected mercy.

### Loremaster’s Desk — extra advice
- **Season the calendar.** Harvest moons, first frosts, the Fell Winter’s memory.
- **Let names carry history.** “This blade was forged in Arthedain ere the Witch‑king came.”
- **Reward clever combat.** One troll > five orcs. Flooded ford, flaming brand, falling stones.
- **Shadow is a choice engine.** Offer treasure with a whisper; offer redemption by renunciation.
- **Rain is drama.** A Weathertop squall can impose Disadvantage on missile fire or swell Fatigue — no monster needed.

---

## 🏡 SIDEBAR: SHIRE‑ONLY ADVENTURE

For bright‑toned Shire games, replace Shadow with **Mischief** (a 0–5 Pressure track).

- At **5**, the crisis is a visit from the Bounders (or Lobelia’s lawyers), then reset Mischief to **0**.
- Journeys are day‑trips; Fatigue is usually trivial.
- Fatal weapons are off the table; the worst dangers are floods, feuds, and foolishness.

Knack seeds: *Second Breakfast* (once per session clear 1 Fatigue with a meal) • *Tookish Curiosity* (once per scene ask the Loremaster for a harmless clue).

---

## LOREMASTER’S MOVES

- **Opening beat:** Greenway patrol finds a black feather; a pie contest in Michel Delving turns strange; a lantern is seen in a barrow‑mouth.
- **Moves:** distant warg howl • red star over Amon Sûl • ranger beacon flare • chilling barrow breeze • a grey traveller’s warning.
- **Pacing:** one lore clue, one peril, one respite — repeat. Shadow rises fastest when greed tempts or courage fails.

> “A single yellow lantern danced in Bree’s west‑gate, like hope holding vigil.”
