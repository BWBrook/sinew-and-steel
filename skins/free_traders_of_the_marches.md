# **FREE TRADERS OF THE MARCHES**
## Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*Spinward Main, I.S.W. 1105. Jump‑flashes bloom in the dark between the stars, patrons wave low‑credit cargo chits, and a worn Type‑A free trader hauls dreams through the Third Imperium.*

_(Paste atop the Sinew & Steel rules; anything not listed here follows the core.)_

Free Traders of the Marches is “blue‑book” space adventure: debt, fuel, patron jobs, hard vacuum, and the quiet terror of a jump that comes out wrong.
Expect clipped comms, messy morality, ports that smile with teeth, and runs where profit and survival are the same problem.

Suggested creation tone: **standard** (**6** build points).

In this skin, the Custodian is often called the **Guildmaster**.

**Micro‑vignette (cold open):**
> “Free Trader *Peregrine*, this is Port Authority. You are cleared for berth… once your outstanding fees are settled. Out.”

## 🚀 FREE TRADER’S HANDBOOK (Adventurer)

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Marches label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Strength (STR)** | lug crates, melee, EVA clamp |
| Reflex | **Dexterity (DEX)** | vacuum pistol, pilot jink, quick patch |
| Intellect | **Education (EDU)** | astrogation, engineering, medicine, xenolinguistics |
| Empathy | **Social (SOC)** | rank, bureaucracy, haggling, morale |
| Luck | **Fate (FAT)** | uncanny breaks **and** token pool |

**Rules reminder:** natural **1** is best; natural **20** is worst (and cannot be nudged).

### Fate (Luck) tokens
Tokens are stamped Imperial credits kept in a battered cred‑clip.

When the Custodian calls for blind chance — “**Test your Fate**!” — roll under your **current credits** (not your maximum).
Spend credits now to nudge rolls, but remember: fewer tokens means shakier Fate later.

A short rest in a safe berth restores **+1 token**; a restful week in port, high-grade liquor or Vilani meditation may restore more.

*“Jump‑shock rippled your fillings; the vox hummed with residual static.”*

### Prior‑Service Knacks (choose one)
Each use costs: **spend 1 Fate token** or **mark +1 Stress**.

| Knack | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Ex‑Marine** | Once per scene, treat one ranged attack as Advantage (ignore recoil/zero‑G). |
| **Scout Surveyor** | Once per scene, test EDU for astrogation/survey with Advantage. |
| **Merchant Broker** | Once per port call, reroll one trade test you just made (keep the new result). |
| **Noble Lineage** | Spend 1 Fate token to pull rank: Advantage on a SOC test with Imperial officials. |
| **Belter Rat** | Once per scene, you automatically succeed on a zero‑G manoeuvre that would otherwise need a test. If you try this in gravity, mark **+1 Stress**. |

### Optional Expertise (choose one stat)
Choose one stat as **Expertise** — pilot (DEX), engineer (EDU), liaison (SOC).
When a task squarely fits your expertise, roll with Advantage.

### Weapons & Edges
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Blade, shock baton | 0 |
| Snub‑pistol (gauss), shotgun | +1 |
| Laser carbine, ACR | +2 |

**Fatal (example):** laser carbine at point‑blank against an unarmoured target — **Fatal (counter: any armour or hard cover)**.

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Jack / flight suit | 0 |
| Combat cloth | 1 |
| Battle dress | 2 |

(Dynamic soak: after a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points** of attacker margin; **nat 1 pierces all**.)

## 🛰️ SHIPBOARD PROCEDURE (core‑aligned)
Traveller tension comes from logistics, debt, and bad odds — but you don’t need extra dice systems to get it.
Use **clocks** plus a few decisive tests.

### Recommended ship clocks
These are story‑facing meters. Make them **public** if you want planning, **hidden** if you want dread.

- **Fuel Depletion (0/4)** — tick **+1** each jump; tick **+2** on a misjump. At **4**, you’re dry: stranded until you refuel.
- **Hull Damage (0/6)** — tick when the ship is hit or the drive strains. At **6**, drive disabled: drift, board, or die.
- **Debt (0/6)** — tick when fees, bribes, or patron penalties land. Clear ticks when you get paid. At **6**, repo attempt / impound / creditor crisis.

> *“Dockmaster’s grin didn’t reach his eyes — even money smells desperate this far spinward.”*

### Jump leg (one travel beat)
When you make a jump (or cross a week of hard travel) and the stakes matter, resolve the leg with up to three tests.
If a role is unfilled, treat it as a failure.

| Role | Test | On success | On failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Astrogator** | EDU | clean emergence | mark **+1 Stress**; on natural **20**: **misjump** (tick Fuel +2, mark +1 Stress, arrive somewhere wrong) |
| **Engineer** | EDU | no wear | mark **+1 Stress** and tick **Hull Damage +1** |
| **Watch officer** | DEX or SOC | early warning (Advantage on first roll next encounter) | surprise encounter or red‑tape delay |

### Ship Shares (party pool)
Ship Shares represent liquid breathing room: fuel bills paid, port fees smoothed, creditors delayed.

- Start at **2 shares** (adjust to tone).
- Spend 1 share to: pay fees, grease a bureaucrat, replace a lost cargo load, or clear **1 tick** from **Hull Damage**.
- If the pool hits **0**, everyone marks **+1 Stress** immediately.

If you want concrete numbers, treat **1 share ~ Cr 10 000** of “problem‑solving money.” (Optional; not required.)

## 📉 STRESS TRACK (Pressure skin)
Stress is crew morale and systems strain. It runs **0–5**; at **5** trigger a crisis, then reset Stress to **0**.

| Step | Indicator | Effect |
|--|--|--|
|0|Green board|—|
|1|Amber caution|cosmetic: crew snappish, hull pings |
|2|High load|Disadvantage on your next **EDU** or **SOC** test |
|3|Over‑taxed|Each **risky test** costs **1 Fate token** (spend before rolling) or marks **+1 Stress** |
|4|Red line|Disadvantage on all tests |
|5 **Crisis**|Panic, mutiny, or hull crisis|Trigger a crisis, reset Stress to **0** |

_(A risky test is any roll where failure would materially change the situation: harm, loss, exposure, separation. Routine talk and obvious chores need no roll.)_

**Gain Stress:** combat hits, jump failures, overdue loans, empty Ship Shares.  
**Clear Stress:** 72‑hour shore leave (costs you something), captain’s commendation (narrative), or a patron payoff that actually lands.

**Stress crisis (pick or roll d6)**  
1 Core flash‑over — everyone loses **1 STM**  
2 Helm panic — veer into hazard (an encounter begins at Disadvantage)  
3 Mutiny spark — immediate social conflict; **SOC** tests at Disadvantage next session  
4 System lockdown — one ship function offline until port repair  
5 Debt call‑in — lose **1 Ship Share** immediately (or tick Debt +1 if at 0 shares)  
6 Roll twice; apply both

Fate is personal risk. Stress is the ship’s mood, its wear, and the crew’s frayed nerves. Your courage may cost the ship its calm.

## 💰 TRADE & PORT CALLS (keep it fast)
When you hit port, resolve money and trouble in one beat.

### Trade test (one per port call)
Test **SOC** (broker it) or **EDU** (read the market).

- **Success:** gain **+1 Ship Share**, or clear **−1 Debt tick**.
- **Failure:** mark **+1 Stress**, or tick **Debt +1** (Guildmaster chooses the more truthful consequence).
- **Natural 20:** both — and someone notices (add a complication: audit, shakedown, or a patron with leverage).

Merchant Broker lets you reroll this once per port call.

### Patron jobs (default structure)
Offer 2–3 jobs. Each job should state:
- payment (Ship Shares / Debt clearance)
- risk (what clocks tick on failure)
- the “catch” (legal, moral, or logistical)

---

## 🩺 MEDICAL AID (supplies clock)
To keep “limited med‑supplies” tension without usage dice, track **Medkit Supplies (0/4)**.

- Each time you treat a serious injury, tick Supplies **+1** and test **EDU**.
  - Success: restore **+1 STM** (up to max).
  - Failure: no healing and mark **+1 Stress** (panic, infection risk, missing meds).
- At **4/4**, the kit is empty until resupplied in port.
- On a natural **20**, the patient worsens (infection, shock, or a botched stitch): lose **1 STM** and mark **+1 Stress**.

---

## ⚠️ GUILDMASTER’S PROTOCOLS (Custodian)
*“The Beowulf‑class liner drifts dead‑stick, running lights blinking in tired semaphore.”*

### Ship‑to‑ship combat (quick module)
Use this when you want a fast dogfight without a tactical map.

- Treat each ship as an NPC with:
  - **Pilot score** (usually 10–14)
  - **Hull Damage clock (0/6)** (or bigger for larger hulls)
  - **Screens soak** (1 civilian, 2 military)
  - **Turret edge** (+1 per turret; high‑energy laser +2)

Each round:
1. Both pilots test **DEX**. Winner gains Advantage on the gunner’s next attack.
2. Gunner tests **DEX** (attack) vs defender pilot’s **DEX** (defend).
3. On a hit, tick Hull Damage by **(1 + turret edge − effective soak)** (dynamic soak applies as normal).
4. At Hull Damage **6**, the drive is disabled: drift, board, or boom per fiction.

Missiles (optional): one salvo per rack. Defender tests **EDU** to jam; on a failed jam, treat the missile as **edge +2** and tick Hull Damage.

### Away‑team “redshirt” rule (no bookkeeping)
When nameless crew accompany the PCs on a dangerous surface beat:

- If the PCs **fail** the key risky test of the beat, the Guildmaster chooses a consequence:
  - one redshirt wounded (lose **1 STM**, needs treatment)
  - one redshirt killed
  - one redshirt missing (later complication)
  - stray hit: a PC loses **1 STM**

If you want randomness, pick or roll d6 on your own table — but keep it fast and fair.

### Sector events (pick or roll d6)
1 Pirate corsair shadows you — demand tribute or combat  
2 Local noble requests a jump courier — lucrative patron  
3 Solar flare: comms blackout; test DEX to protect sensors (failure marks +1 Stress)  
4 Scout X‑boat drops war rumours on the next main; mark +1 Stress  
5 Merchant prince auctions rare jump fuel (bid Ship Shares or take Debt ticks)  
6 Derelict liner beacons: salvage claim vs rescue ethics

### FF‑style branching episode tips (solo / duet)
- Number planned scenes (001–050). Each ends with 2–3 numbered choices.
- Pair each node with a quick note: “003 — cargo hold / vacuum hazard / Stress +1 on fail.”
- This is for pacing and solo structure — **not** rewinds. Keep a log; consequences stick.

### Writing in Miller & Chadwick register (blue‑book polish)
- Technical brevity: “Type‑A2 Far Trader *Peregrine*, 200‑ton.”
- Sparse wonder: one vivid detail per scene (rings, aurora, hull frost).
- Understated danger: pirates transmit terse ultimatums; they don’t cackle.
- Economic motive drives plot: debt, fuel, speculative cargo — the crew feels every credit.
- Staccato comms: clipped phrases. End transmissions with “Out.”
- Hex references: sprinkle coordinates. Worlds get a UWP line, then one evocative sentence.

### Guildmaster moves
Port fees double; lien threatens impound • Pirate corsair on scan • Misfuelled jump contaminates the drive • Patron offers time‑critical cargo • Lingering sickness on board.
