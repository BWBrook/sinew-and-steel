# **BRIAR & BENEDICTINE**
## Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*A Benedictine abbey, England, winter of 1142. Murder, heresy, and siege swirl beyond the cloister walls.*

_(Paste atop the Sinew & Steel rules; anything not listed here follows the core.)_

Briar & Benedictine is a monastic mystery skin: investigation under vows, secrets behind stone, and the spiritual cost of prying into darkness.
Expect interrogation-by-confession, forensic herbs, whispered politics, and violence that is rare but final.

Suggested creation tone: **grim** (**0** build points) — frail bodies, sharp minds, hard choices.
If you want a more capable party, raise build points (standard **6** or pulp **12**) without changing any other rules.

## ✝️ CHAPTERHOUSE SECRETS (Adventurer)

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Abbey label | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Hew (HEW)** | heaving stones, wrestling soldiers, cracking doors |
| Reflex | **Fleet (FLT)** | stealth in cloisters, quick footing, sleight |
| Intellect | **Lore (LOR)** | herbalism, forensics, Latin, canon law |
| Empathy | **Mercy (MCY)** | soothing souls, interrogation, reading hearts |
| Luck | **Providence (PRV)** | divine fortune **and** token pool |

**Rules reminder:** natural **1** is best; natural **20** is worst (and cannot be nudged).

### Providence (Luck) flavour
Tokens are carved hazel beads on a rosary.

When the Custodian calls for blind chance — “**Test your Providence**!” — roll under your **current beads** (not your maximum).
Spend beads now to nudge rolls, but remember: fewer beads means shakier Providence later.

A short rest in quiet prayer restores **+1 bead**; vigil at a martyr’s shrine (or true absolution) may restore more.

>*“Tenebrae non comprehenderunt lucem.”*<br>_The darkness grasped not the light._

### Common tests (defaults)
Pick the attribute that matches the approach (not “the correct stat”).

- **HEW:** force a door, grapple a soldier, hold a gate.  
- **FLT:** slip past novices, eavesdrop, flee through cloisters.  
- **LOR:** inks, herbs, forensics, scripture, law.  
- **MCY:** calm a witness, read motives, extract truth without cruelty.  
- **PRV:** omens, coincidence, the one-in-a-thousand break.

### Edges & Arms
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Staff, rope trap | 0 |
| Cudgel, short sword | +1 |
| Crossbow bolt, pole-axe | +2 *(rare; militia only)* |

>*“Cold iron bells toll terce — crows answer from the graveyard yew.”*

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Monk's cowl | 0 |
| Quilted gambeson | 1 |
| Mail shirt & nasal helm | 2 |

(Dynamic soak: after a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points** of attacker margin; **nat 1 pierces all**.)

### Optional plug-ins (use sparingly)
- **Insight (once per scene).** After you succeed on a **LOR** or **MCY** test while pursuing the case, you may spend **1 Providence bead** to ask the Custodian one **yes/no** question.
  - The Custodian answers truthfully, but only with what the character could plausibly infer.
- **Herbal poultice.** The healer loses **1 STM**, then tests **LOR**.
  - Success: restore **+1 STM** to another (up to max).
  - Failure: restore nothing and mark **+1 Sin** (prideful meddling).
- **Vow-break.** Violence on church grounds marks **+1 Sin** (no roll).

>*“A candle gutters; for an instant the scriptorium smells of brimstone.”*

## ECUMENICAL NOTES (Custodian)

### The Abbey Case (mystery procedure)
This skin is a Cadfael‑style mystery. Keep it moving with two table rules:

- **Clues are never gated by rolls.** A test decides clarity, speed, and cost — not whether the clue exists.
  - Success: the clue is clear.
  - Failure: you still get a clue, but you pay (mark **Sin**, tick a clock, lose **STM**, draw suspicion).
- **Three leads, always.** Any conclusion you want the players to reach should have at least **three** clues pointing toward it, in different places or mouths.

Use the **Insight** plug‑in as your “unstick lever” if the table stalls.

**Micro‑example (how to run a clue):**
> Cadoc scrapes blood from the altar cloth. Test **LOR**.  
> Success: “It’s old blood — at least five days — and it reeks of yarrow.”  
> Failure: “It’s old blood… but your hands shake. Mark **+1 Sin**: prideful certainty can damn the innocent.”

### Sin Track (Pressure skin)
Sin is the spiritual pressure of suspicion, pride, and proximity to evil. It runs **0–5**; at **5** trigger a crisis, then reset Sin to **0**.

| Step | Portent | Custodian leverage |
|--|--|--|
|0|Clear conscience|—|
|1|Rumours in cloister|cosmetic whispers, doors close early|
|2|Brother’s doubt|Disadvantage on **MCY** tests with clergy NPCs|
|3|Official censure|The Abbot (or your Prior) forbids inquiry. Any **test** you make in open defiance costs: **spend 1 PRV bead** (a Providence token) *before rolling*, or mark **+1 Sin**.|
|4|Dark night of soul|**Test your Providence** at Disadvantage|
|5 **Crisis**|Ecclesiastical trial / demonic visitation|roll crisis table, reset to **0**|

**Gain Sin:** lie under oath, break a vow of peace, disturb a sanctified grave, use Insight on sacred matters for petty ends.  
**Purge Sin:** public confession (lose a favoured item), week‑long fast, hazardous pilgrimage.

**Crisis table (d6)**  
1 Public scourging — lose **1 STM**; the penance resets Sin to **0**  
2 Possessed by pride — Custodian controls the PC for one scene  
3 Devil’s whisper — your next **MCY** test against a suspect is at Disadvantage  
4 Lost reliquary — a key piece of evidence vanishes  
5 Chapter trial — Disadvantage on all rolls next session  
6 Roll twice; apply both

### Tone
Lean, sensory: “Iron brazier hisses as herbs crack; the air stinks of blood and rosemary.” Violence is rare but final.
“The devil prowls like a wolf among lambs — yet wolves leave tracks.”

>*“Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?”*

### Custodian moves
Sheriff arrives • Siege rumours tighten trade • Storm floods Severn • Skeleton unearthed under nave • A confession implicates the wrong person.

> **GRIM PORTENT •** A parchment seal pops in the warming brazier, disgorging blackened petals onto the refectory table. All present test **MCY**; on failure, mark **+1 Sin** from dread.

### Investigation map (keep it simple)
Tag scenes by location (CL‑1 cloister, TW‑2 town, WD‑3 woodland). Keep a short case ledger: suspects, motives, alibis, clue list.

This skin does **not** rewind: words cannot be unspoken, vows cannot be unbroken — only confession and atonement can change what comes next.

>*“Wax gutters in crooked rivulets; the effigy saints seem to weep.”*

### d6 Quick mystery seeds
| d6 | Hook | Twist |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A novice vanishes after night‑office. | His sandal prints stop at the sealed reliquary vault. |
| 2 | A blood‑spattered missal is found on the high altar. | Ink tests reveal the blood is **five days old**—mass was said yesterday. |
| 3 | A travelling minstrel collapses, raving of a silver stag. | His purse holds a coin minted two centuries hence. |
| 4 | Siege engines rumble outside; the abbot’s ring is stolen. | The culprit left a scrap of *royal* livery, not rebel colours. |
| 5 | The infirmary leech‑jar is missing; patients worsen. | An apothecary in town pays double for rare blood elixir. |
| 6 | A parchment map to a Saxon tomb appears in Cadoc’s cell. | The handwriting matches the Prior—dead these ten years. |
