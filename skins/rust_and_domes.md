# **RUST & DOMES**
### Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system

![](../assets/covers/ss_logo_rust_and_domes.png){.wrap-right width=0.45in}

*Gritty exploits on a colonised Red Planet, circa 2205 AE.*

_(Paste atop the Sinew & Steel rules; anything not listed here follows the core.)_

Rust & Domes is hard‑sci‑fi frontier play: dust and domes, corporate rot, and people who will sell you oxygen.
Expect salvage, heists, mag‑rail runs, life‑support scares, and hard choices made under cameras.

Suggested creation tone: **standard** (**6** build points) — gritty but capable operatives.

## COLONIST'S HANDBOOK (Adventurer)
*A fast‑moving toolkit for dust‑choked sci‑fi adventure.*

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Mars label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Attack (ATK)** | firearms, blades, throwing, brute violence |
| Reflex | **Defence (DEF)** | dodging fire, reactive shields, evasive driving |
| Intellect | **Skill (SKL)** | hacking, piloting, repair, sleight |
| Empathy | **Mind (MND)** | composure, persuasion, mental shock, psionics |
| Luck | **Luck (LCK)** | fortune **and** token pool |

**Rules reminder:** natural **1** is best; natural **20** is worst (and cannot be nudged).

### Luck (LCK) flavour
Tokens are battered cred‑chits.

When the Custodian calls for blind chance — “**Test your Luck**!” — roll under your **current cred‑chits** (not your maximum).
Spend tokens now to nudge rolls, but remember: fewer tokens means shakier Luck later.

A short rest in a safe hab restores **+1 cred‑chit**; stim packs or narrative boons may restore more.

### Weapons & Edges (baseline colony tech)
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Combat knife, sap | 0 |
| Service pistol, boarding sabre | +1 |
| Laser carbine, flechette rifle, thermal cutter | +2 |

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Work suit / dust cloak | 0 |
| Kevlar wrap or reinforced vac‑suit | 1 |
| Composite plate / powered hardsuit | 2 |
| Carbite battlearmour | 3 |

(Dynamic soak: after a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points** of attacker margin; **nat 1 pierces all**.)

### Recovery
![](../assets/art/ss_rust_domes_oxygen_gauge.png){.wrap-right width=1.25in trim="0.15in 0.15in 0.15in 0.15in"}

A short breather with clean water restores **+1 STM**; a full med‑bay cycle or expert field surgeon restores **+2 STM** (up to max).
Critical injuries may require med‑gel, cybernetic grafts, or a night in the autodoc.

### Equipment & Burden
Six big items (long guns, bulky toolkits, sealed cargo). Extra load ⇒ Disadvantage on **DEF** tests.
Flashing digi‑coin draws attention from Syndicate footpads and corp‑security alike.

### Psionics (optional plug‑in)
Hard vacuum, cobalt storms, and stray solar flux have coaxed a minority of colonists into weak **M‑field sensitives**.
Psionics ride **Mind (MND)** and slot in beside guns and hacks — no extra dice.

| Step | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Activate** | Test **MND**. Spend Luck to nudge as usual. |
| **On success** | The effect manifests (see table). Extra margin means stronger, subtler, or broader — at the Custodian’s discretion. |
| **On failure** | Your spike pings a scanner: mark **+1 Heat** and suffer Disadvantage on the next psionic test this scene. |
| **Cost** | Each use costs **1 STM** (nosebleed, neural shock). You may instead spend **1 LCK token** to ignore the fatigue. |

#### Quick Power Menu
| Power | Baseline effect |
|---|---|
| **Telepathic Probe** | Read surface thoughts of one target in sight. Margin ≥ 8 lifts buried memories. |
| **Kinetic Shove** | Inflict **1 STM** (no edge) or knock a human‑sized target prone; margin ≥ 4 can hurl them across the room. |
| **Neuro‑Veil** | For one minute, hide from basic sensors/cams; margin ≥ 6 cloaks an adjacent ally too. |
| **Chrono‑Glitch** | Glimpse a likely outcome of the next beat (Custodian gives a one‑sentence omen). Margin ≥ 10 lets you ask a yes/no follow‑up. |

Psionics can’t pierce psi‑mesh helmets (rare, expensive) and never alter natural **1s** or **20s**.
Chrono‑Glitch is not a rewind — it’s an omen.

Because each miss spikes **Heat**, repeated misuse draws Corp‑Sec “mind‑scrub” squads in a hurry.
Use sparingly; Mars already wants your mind.

### Pressure Track — **Heat**
Heat is Corporate and Syndicate scrutiny. It runs **0–5**; at **5** trigger a crisis, then reset Heat to **0**.

A **risky test** is any roll where failure would materially change the situation (harm, loss, alarm, exposure). Routine travel and obvious chores need no roll.

| Step | HUD colour | Custodian effects |
|--|--|--|
|0|Green|Clear |
|1|Blue flicker|Cosmetic: rumours, routine scans |
|2|Yellow|Minor Disadvantage on black‑market deals |
|3|Orange|Bounty posted; NPC suspicion |
|4|Red|Walls have eyes: each **risky test** you attempt marks **+1 Heat** (even on success). Habitats lock doors. |
|5 Crisis|Crimson alert|Trigger Heat crisis, reset to **0** |

**Gain Heat:** failed covert tests, public gunfire, traced hacks, reckless media leaks.  
**Clear Heat:** pay bribes (lose creds/item), lay low an entire session, or do a favour for the controlling corp.

**Heat crisis (d6):**

| d6 | Crisis |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Corp‑Sec raid (combat or surrender) |
| 2 | Syndicate kidnaps ally |
| 3 | Bounty hunters strike en route |
| 4 | Bio‑sensor lockout: habitat denies life support |
| 5 | Universal arrest warrant (Disadvantage on all social tests next session) |
| 6 | Roll twice; apply both |

### Milestone Boon Seeds
Salvage permit (once ignore **+1 Heat** from a single trigger) • Dome Elder favour (Advantage in one social scene) • Pre‑Collapse alloy blade (+1 edge) • Hidden cache (refill Luck pool mid‑run) • Scrambler code (Advantage on your next SKL hack).

## CONTROLLER'S DOSSIER (Custodian)
*An operational brief for weaving intrigue, peril, and dust‑choked wonder across the Red Frontier.*

In Rust & Domes, the Custodian is often called the **Controller** — the one watching the HUD and deciding what the system does next.

### Red‑Dust Tone
Keep prose lean. Hardboiled noir on Olympus Mons: dust devils along the mag‑rail; jet exhaust etching rust into the sky.
Tech is rusting, corps are bloated carrion birds, and wonder haunts ghost domes.

**Micro‑vignette (frame a beat):**

> The airlock cycles with a cough. Red dust scuttles across the deck like insects. Somewhere in the dome, an alarm is trying not to panic.

Defeat should twist the story rather than break it: prison work crews, debt, blackmail, a memory‑wipe implant.
Death is for pathos, not arithmetic.

### Default Martian kit (optional setting spine)
![](../assets/art/ss_rust_domes_dome_skyline.png){.wrap-right width=1.35in trim="0.15in 0.15in 0.15in 0.15in"}

If you want a ready map: four underground settlements.
Hearthwell (old), Mirage Junction (new, crime‑ridden), Cobalt Array (science station), Gantry Point (outpost under construction: contact mysteriously lost).
Colonies established by **Perihelion Mining Corporation (PMC)** after rich aresite strikes.

### Martian threats (quick bestiary seeds)
If you want fast, punchy threats that feel *Martian* without needing a long bestiary, start with:

- **Crusher** — bipedal brute; armoured hide; hits like a piledriver.
- **Dust Slug** — burrows under the sand; erupts beneath boots and vehicles.
- **Sand Snatcher** — huge predator with jaws like a mining clamp; stalks the edge of light.
- **Shockcrab** — alien crustacean; emits a gut‑turning shockwave when threatened.
- **Spine Urchin** — spined crawler; poisonous barbs; can “shoot” spines at close range.
- **Thresher** — lank, whipping‑armed horror that closes fast in tight corridors.

### Beat & Graph notes
Open with a sensory hook (sand rasping against a visor, antiseptic med‑gel, the tang of ozone), follow with decisive action, end at a fork.
Tag nodes by dome/quadrant (HW‑01, MJ‑A2) and keep a short “job ledger”: objective, debts, Heat triggers, casualties.

This skin does **not** rewind. If you want an in‑fiction safety net, use **blackbox logs** as clues — footage doesn’t change what happened.

### Tricks & Tactics
Creative stunts are encouraged. Fire‑suppression foam may smother a plasma arc; a grappling drone can provide swift exfiltration.
Reward ingenuity with Advantage or narrative leverage.

### Controller moves
![](../assets/art/ss_rust_domes_audit_stamp.png){.wrap-right width=1.15in trim="0.15in 0.15in 0.15in 0.15in"}

Life‑support warning • Rail‑cannon test quake • Terraformer glitch kicks up storm • Corp auditor arrives • Nomads block the pass.
After a heist concluded, a secret unearthed, or a dust‑storm crossing survived, grant a Milestone.
When in doubt favour bold action but remember that every triumph on rust‑red soil comes smeared with dust and danger.

### Luck (LCK) Guidance
Call Luck when chance, bureaucracy, or a random supply crate decides.
Keep it to 1–2 per session — Mars is harsh, but not roulette.

> *Use this dossier like a smuggler’s map — spill coffee on it, cross out old threats, ink in new ones. Mars is alive, merciless, and waiting.*
