# **CANDLELIGHT DUNGEONS**
### Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system

![](../assets/covers/ss_logo_candlelight_dungeons.png){.wrap-right width=0.45in trim="441bp 204bp 438bp 169bp"}

*Torchlit delves in the warrens of a dying principality, inspired by classic 1980s dungeon‑crawl play.*

_(Paste atop the Sinew & Steel rules; anything not listed here follows the core.)_

Candlelight Dungeons is old‑school dungeon‑crawl play: mapping by torchlight, hard bargains, traps that hurt, and monsters with motives.
Expect heroic competence under grim pressure — the dungeon is mean, but you are not helpless.

Suggested creation tone: **heroic** (**16** build points).
If you want a meat‑grinder crawl, lower build points (standard **6** or grim **0**) without changing any other rules.

## DELVER'S KIT (Adventurer)

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Dungeon label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Strength (STR)** | breaking doors, swinging axes, hauling loot |
| Reflex | **Dexterity (DEX)** | stealth, traps, missile aim |
| Intellect | **Lore (LOR)** | occult knowledge, arcane casting, riddles |
| Empathy | **Faith (FTH)** | divine petitions, morale, turning undead |
| Luck | **Fortune (FOR)** | sheer chance **and** token pool |

**Rules reminder:** natural **1** is best; natural **20** is worst (and cannot be nudged).

### Fortune (Luck) flavour
Tokens are tarnished silver coins.

When the Custodian calls for blind chance — “**Test your Fortune**!” — roll under your **current coins** (not your maximum).
Spend coins now to nudge rolls, but remember: fewer coins means shakier Fortune later.

A short rest at a warm hearth restores **+1 coin**; dank caves do not.

### Weapons & Edges
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Dagger, club | 0 |
| Sword, spear, short bow | +1 |
| Greataxe, heavy crossbow | +2 |

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Robes / common clothes | 0 |
| Leather | 1 |
| Chain shirt | 2 |
| Plate & shield | 3 |

(Dynamic soak: after a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points** of attacker margin; **nat 1 pierces all**.)

## SPELLCRAFT
![](../assets/art/ss_candlelight_spell_backlash.png){.margin-right width=0.95in trim="399bp 223bp 372bp 83bp"}

> *Spells are named effects tagged to a tier when learned. Test under the listed stat, then pay the tier cost.*

| Tier | Cast with | On **success** | On **failure** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cantrip** | LOR or FTH | no cost | no cost |
| **Spell** | LOR or FTH | choose: spend **1 FOR coin** *or* mark **+1 Fatigue** | mark **+1 Fatigue** |
| **Greater** | LOR or FTH (**Fortune cannot aid**) | mark **+1 Fatigue** anyway | mark **+2 Fatigue** and Custodian backlash |
| **Wyrd** | LOR or FTH (**Fortune cannot aid**) | the effect manifests (nat 1 = legend) | backlash **and** roll a Fatigue crisis immediately (reset to **0**) |

*Learn a spell by study, scroll, or blessing → agree its tier with the Custodian → note it: “**Sleep — Spell (LOR)**”.*

**Wyrd procedure:** mark **+2 Fatigue**, then roll.

**Backlash snippet:** demon whisper (Disadvantage next cast) • mana flare (all torches snuff) • witch‑mark (your next rest restores **no** Fortune).

## FATIGUE TRACK (Pressure skin)
![](../assets/art/ss_candlelight_torch_sconce.png){.margin-right width=0.95in trim="555bp 151bp 654bp 67bp"}

Fatigue is the dungeon’s hourglass. It runs **0–5**; at **5** trigger a crisis, then reset Fatigue to **0**.

| Step | Portent | Effect |
|--|--|--|
|0|Fresh|—|
|1|Winded|cosmetic sweat, shaky torch |
|2|Weary|Disadvantage on your next **STR** or **DEX** test |
|3|Exhausted|Attacks against you have Advantage |
|4|Ragged|Each **risky test** costs **1 FOR coin** (spend before rolling) or mark **+1 Fatigue** |
|5 **Crisis**|Collapse / spell backlash|Roll Fatigue crisis, reset to **0** |

*Gain:* failed spells, forced marches, grave wounds, night without rest.  
*Clear:* sleep, hearty stew, or a miracle that removes Fatigue.

**Fatigue crisis (d6)**

| d6 | Crisis |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Collapse — drop what you’re holding; lose your next action |
| 2 | Torch‑gutter — light falters; the next beat begins in dimness or dark |
| 3 | Cramp — lose **1 STM**; you can’t run until you rest |
| 4 | Wrong turn — you blunder into trouble or split the party (Custodian chooses) |
| 5 | Backlash — if any magic was used this scene, it twists (Custodian chooses); otherwise: a trap triggers “late” |
| 6 | Roll twice; apply both |

_(A risky test is any roll where failure would materially change the situation: harm, loss, alarm, separation. Routine mapping and careful talk need no roll.)_

---

## KNACKS (choose one per PC)
Once per scene, do a signature trick. Pay **1 Fortune coin** or mark **+1 Fatigue**.

| Knack | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Backstab** | If you strike from surprise, the hit is **Fatal (counter: awake or gorget helmet)**. |
| **Turn Undead** | Test **FTH**. Success: lesser undead recoil for a beat; margin ≥ **8** destroys one lesser undead (or scatters the pack). Failure: mark **+1 Fatigue**. |
| **Second Wind** | Regain **+1 STM** and shake off one Disadvantage affecting you. |
| **Arcane Flex** | Cast one **Spell**‑tier effect as if it were a **Cantrip** (no cost). Your next cast this scene is at Disadvantage. |
| **Beast Tongue** | Auto‑succeed one attempt to calm, lure, or bargain with a natural creature (Custodian sets the terms). |
| **Jack‑of‑Trades** | After you roll but before you spend Fortune to nudge, treat the roll as governed by a different stat. |

---

## EXPERTISE (choose one stat)
Pick one stat as your **Expertise**.
When the task squarely fits that expertise, roll with **Advantage** (no class labels needed).

---

## TOOLS & TAGS
- **Lockpick satchel** — Advantage on **DEX** tests to open/disarm when you have access. On a natural **20**, the picks snap (spent).
- **Holy symbol** — required focus for Turn Undead; shatters on **FTH** natural **20**.

## CHRONICLER’S LANTERN (Custodian)
_Custodian guidance in the spirit of classic dungeon‑crawl refereeing_

**1. Open with the torch, not the rulebook.**  
Give mossy flagstones, a draught that smells of old iron, the scrape of scaled hide on stone. Roll only when the next step could maim or enrich.

**2. Map behind the screen, mystery before it.**  
Keep a scratch grid of rooms, traps, and wandering signs. Let fear be earned by the choice of corridor.

**3. Rulings over rules, always.**  
When a delver tries the unexpected — pouring oil down a murder‑hole, bargaining with a skeleton — judge it cleanly, call for a single test at most, and let the tale run.

**4. Treasure is tempo.**  
A purse of 50 silver keeps iron rations flowing; a ruby the size of a child’s heart funds the next delve. Tie milestones to discoveries, not body counts.

**5. Monsters want something.**  
Goblins barter for lamp oil, ghouls crave tales of grief, muck‑ogres yearn for refuse. One motive line turns fodder into story.

**6. Fatigue is the hourglass.**  
Every torch burned, every spell miscast, every wrong turn adds weight to shoulders. When Fatigue climbs, describe ringing ears and shaking knees — players will beg for daylight on their own.

**7. Danger at every threshold, death at few.**  
One lethal trap per session keeps courage taut; the rest should maim, scare, or split the party’s purse. You want them limping, not quitting.

**8. End each beat on a hook.**  
“Beyond the door lies laughter… or weeping.” Offer two or three choices: one should sparkle with gold, one should reek of doom, one should whisper old lore.

**9. Keep the lexicon vivid but lean.**  
Sprinkle five‑dollar words like saffron, never by the ladle: _miasma_, _balustrade_, _chthonic_. Let action carry the prose.

**10. Reward ingenuity with Advantage, hubris with peril.**  
Pole‑tapping every slab should find hidden hinges; charging the idol deserves the hail of darts. Fairness is the forge of legend.

> _“The candle guttered; the map stained with sweat. Ahead: a door iron‑banded and warm to the touch. Choose, delvers.”_

Hold that cadence and the ghosts of ’83 will nod in approval.

### Chronicler flavour bullets
- Sweat drips into guttering sconces; fat spatters like rain on hot stone.  
- The corridor air tastes of copper and mildew.  
- A single rat squeals, then silence — too complete.  

- **Sensory kick‑starters:** wet limestone drip • torch oil hisses • waft of grave rosemary.  
- **Moves:** loose flagstone drops to pit • goblin horn echoes • mould spores force **STR** test (mark **+1 Fatigue** on failure).  
- **Beat tags:** CR‑1 (crypt), ST‑3 (stair), WD‑2 (wilderness).

---

### Fatal tag (reminder)
**Fatal** ignores Stamina and soak: a struck target drops to **0 STM** unless they possess the listed counter‑measure.

Example: Assassin’s throat‑slit on a sleeping victim — **Fatal (counter: staying awake or wearing a gorget helmet while resting)**.
