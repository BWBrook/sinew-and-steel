# **TWILIGHT OF THE NORTHLANDS**
### Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system

![](../assets/covers/ss_logo_twilight_northlands.png){.wrap-right width=0.45in trim="410bp 183bp 409bp 134bp"}

*The Northlands, late in a fading age. The Wardens keep lonely watch, dread gathers in forgotten tombs, and humble folk cherish hearth‑fires against the returning dark.*

_(Paste atop the Sinew & Steel rules; anything not listed here follows the core.)_

Twilight of the Northlands is wanderer fantasy: long roads, hard choices, and small lights carried through large darkness.
Expect travels, assemblies, songs in the cold, and moments where the enemy is fought as much in the heart as with the sword.

Suggested creation tone: **heroic** (**16** build points).

In this skin, the Custodian is often called the **Lorekeeper**.

**Micro‑vignette (cold open):**

> The Old Road lies empty. The wind smells of rain and old stone. Somewhere beyond the next rise, a black bird cries — and the sound echoes like a question.

## WANDERER’S ADD‑ON (Adventurer)

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Northern label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Strength (STR)** | brawn, climbing ruins, hard strikes |
| Reflex | **Nimbleness (NIM)** | stealth, archery, pony‑handling |
| Intellect | **Wisdom (WIS)** | lore, riddles, subtle craft, old songs |
| Empathy | **Heart (HRT)** | courage, persuasion, resisting dread |
| Luck | **Hope (HOP)** | fate‑tokens **and** inner light |

**Rules reminder:** natural **1** is best; natural **20** is worst (and cannot be nudged).

### Hope (Luck) tokens
Hope (HOP) is both a stat and a pool. Write it as **HOP current/max**.

When the Lorekeeper calls for blind chance — “**Test your Hope**!” — roll under your **current Hope** (not your maximum).
Spend Hope now to nudge rolls, but remember: fewer tokens means shakier Hope later.

A short rest by a safe fire restores **+1 Hope token**; a true sanctuary or a season of peace may restore more.

> “Mist pooled in the knife‑cuts of the hills, silver in moon’s waning glow.”

### Companionship pool (shared nudges only)
Companionship is a shared reserve the company leans on when one heart falters.

- Start with **1 Companionship token per PC** (maximum = number of PCs).
- **Once per scene, each PC may spend 1 token from Companionship** instead of spending their own Hope to **nudge a roll**.
- Companionship tokens may be used **only** to nudge rolls (not to pay knack costs, rite costs, or other expenses).
- When the pool reaches **0**, each PC immediately **marks +1 Dread**.

_(Harness note: this works cleanly as a campaign clock with `current/max`.)_

### Cultural Knacks (pick one)
Each use costs: **spend 1 Hope token** or **mark +1 Dread**.  
(You cannot pay this cost with Companionship; it must be personal.)

| Culture | Knack | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Halfling** | *Small & Quiet* | Once per scene, automatically succeed on a NIM stealth test against Big‑folk watchers. |
| **Warden** | *Keen Eyes* | Once per scene, gain Advantage on one WIS scan in a wild place. |
| **Dwarf** | *Stout‑Heart* | Once per session, ignore an incoming +1 Dread mark you would take (fear, taint, betrayal). |
| **Elf** | *Starlit Memory* | Once per scene, ask the Lorekeeper one yes/no lore truth about your current situation. |
| **Trader** | *Plain Speech* | Once per scene, gain Advantage on one HRT test to barter, gossip, or calm folk in a settlement. |

### Weapons & Edges
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Dagger, sling‑stone | 0 |
| Sword, spear, short bow | +1 |
| Great spear, longbow, heavy axe | +2 |

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Leather jerkin | 0 |
| Riveted mail | 1 |
| Hauberk & shield | 2 |

(Dynamic soak: after a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points** of attacker margin; **nat 1 pierces all**.)

*Fatal tag (example):* Giant's club **Fatal (counter: heavy shield or dodge with Advantage)**.

## SUBTLE MAGIC — Old Rites
![](../assets/art/ss_twilight_rune_stone.png){.margin-right width=0.95in trim="410bp 188bp 412bp 154bp"}

Rites do not hurl fire. They kindle courage, veil footsteps, and turn the will — softly, rarely, and with a price.

| Tier | Cast with | On success | On failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Whisper** | WIS | none | none |
| **Rite** | WIS | choose: spend **1 Hope** *or* mark **+1 Dread** | mark **+1 Dread** |
| **Invocation** | WIS *(no nudging)* | mark **+1 Dread** | mark **+2 Dread** and Lorekeeper backlash |
| **Unspeakable** | mark **+2 Dread**, then roll | cost stands | **Break** (bout of despair) |

**No nudging (Invocation):** you may not spend Hope or Companionship to nudge this roll.

**Lorekeeper backlash (examples):** a cold wind answers; a wight’s attention turns your way; an oath‑mark burns; a black bird follows for days.

**Break (bout of despair):** for the rest of the scene, you cannot spend Hope or Companionship to nudge rolls, and the Lorekeeper chooses (or offers you) an impulse: flee, freeze, lash out, or fall into grief.

Examples: *Kindle Hearth‑Fire* (Rite), *Silence the Footfall* (Whisper), *Banish a Tomb‑Wight* (Invocation).

---

## FATIGUE — Travels (per‑character track)

Fatigue measures road‑wear: wet boots, empty bellies, and too many miles under a hostile sky.

Track Fatigue per character: **0–5**.

**Each travel leg** (longer than a day) calls for one test chosen by the Guide:  
STR (rugged climb) • NIM (river ford) • WIS (navigation among ruins) • HRT (lead weary companions)

- **Failure:** mark **+1 Fatigue** (for the character who failed; or for everyone, if the whole party blundered).
- **At Fatigue 3+:** each **risky test during the travel** costs **1 Hope token** (spend before rolling) or marks **+1 Fatigue**.
- **At Fatigue 5:** you are **spent**. You cannot take another travel leg until you rest in true comfort; the Lorekeeper makes a hard travel move (separation, injury, pursuit, lost time).

**Clear Fatigue:** a night in true comfort clears all Fatigue; a warm campfire and dry socks clear 1.

**Song of Rest:** if a PC leads a song/story and passes **HRT**, each party member may either recover **+1 Hope token** or clear **1 Fatigue**.

> “Cold stars mirrored on the tomb‑stones, yet none were as cold as the hush within.”

---

## DREAD TRACK (Pressure)

Dread is temptation, fear, and the slow creep of despair. It runs **0–5**; at **5** trigger a crisis, then reset Dread to **0**.

| Step | Sign | Effect |
|--|--|--|
| 0 | Bright spirit | — |
| 1 | Gloom | cosmetic foreboding |
| 2 | Weight of worry | Disadvantage on your next HRT test vs dread |
| 3 | Dark whispers | each **risky test** costs **1 Hope token** (spend before rolling) or marks **+1 Dread** |
| 4 | Twisted will | Disadvantage on all tests |
| 5 **Crisis** | Corruption, despair, or the enemy’s hand | roll Dread Crisis; reset Dread to **0** |

_(A risky test is any roll where failure would materially change the situation: harm, loss, exposure, separation, betrayal. Routine talk and obvious chores need no roll.)_

**Gain Dread:** witnessing true evil, oath‑breaking, tainted ground, hoarding while others starve, failing Invocations, spending Companionship down to 0.

**Purge (rare):** set Dread to **0** after a true cleansing scene — song in a sanctuary, a grave confession to a wise mentor, or a gift freely given that costs you something.

**Dread Crisis (pick or roll d6)**

| d6 | Crisis |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Sudden greed — the company loses **1 Companionship token** (if any remain) |
| 2 | Black despair — you are helpless for one scene (you may only defend or speak) |
| 3 | Dread‑tongue — Disadvantage on your next social test this session |
| 4 | Hope gutters — set your Hope to **0** (current only; max unchanged) |
| 5 | Doom‑mark — foes sense you; the next dangerous encounter begins at Disadvantage |
| 6 | Roll twice; apply both |

## LOREKEEPER’S CHRONICLE (Custodian)

### Travel Roles (optional micro‑module)
Assign up to three roles on any travel leg longer than a day.

| Role | Test each leg | On success | On failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Guide** (navigates) | WIS | stay on course | each PC marks **+1 Fatigue** |
| **Scout** (finds camps) | NIM | safe campsite; one PC clears **1 Fatigue** | random hazard encounter |
| **Look‑out** (watches) | HRT | early warning (Advantage first roll next encounter) | ambush; foes gain Advantage |

If a role is unfilled, treat the test as an auto‑fail.

### Assemblies & Entreaties
When the company must sway a high commissioner, an innkeeper, or a clan lord:

- Set an **Assembly threshold** (3 for a petty lord, 5 for a great lord).
- Each speaking PC rolls **HRT** once:
  - success = **+1**
  - failure = **+0**
  - natural **1** = **+2**
  - natural **20** = **−1**
- PCs may spend Hope to nudge rolls as usual; Companionship tokens may also be spent **only** for nudging.
- If the company reaches the threshold: favour granted. If not: partial help, conditions, or refusal.

### Optional combat module: Tactical Positions & Injurious Blows
Use this only if you want a little road‑fantasy texture in combat without leaving the Sinew & Steel chassis.
It adds two ideas:

- **Resilience** = Stamina loss (ordinary hits wear you down).
- **Injury** = significant lingering damage (e.g., a lacerating or crushing blow that gets through a defence).

#### Combat Positions (choose each exchange)
![](../assets/art/ss_twilight_combat_positions.png){.margin-right width=0.95in trim="129bp 398bp 40bp 346bp"}

At the start of each combat exchange (or “round”), each PC chooses a position in the line:

| Position | Attack | Defence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vanguard** | Advantage | Disadvantage | Bold, exposed. You cannot take this stance while **Injured**. |
| **Steady** | — | — | Balanced. |
| **Watchful** | Disadvantage | Advantage | Cautious; shield‑high, eyes up. |
| **Ranged** | missile weapons only (Advantage) | — | You fight from behind the line. If you are engaged in melee, your defence is at Disadvantage unless an ally screens you. |

_(Defence is the defender’s opposed roll: usually NIM to dodge/cover, STR to parry with shield/weapon, or HRT to stand firm against fear‑driven threats — as fits the fiction.)_

#### Injurious blows → lacerations, punctures, broken bones
When you score a hit, first apply the normal Stamina loss and soak rules.

Then check for an **injurious blow**:
- Always: the attacker rolled a natural **1** on the attack test.
- Optional (grittier): the hit lands with **effective margin 8+**.

**Effective margin:** if both sides succeeded, it’s *(attacker margin − defender margin)*. If the defender failed, it’s simply *(attacker margin)*.

On an injurious blow, the target makes a **Deflection test**:
- Roll d20 under **Deflection = 10 + (Soak × 2)**.
- You may spend Hope (or Companionship, if available) to nudge as normal.

If you **fail**, you gain the condition **Injured**.

**Injured (condition):**
- Record it as a note on your sheet (e.g., `Injured: gash to the thigh`).
- While Injured: Disadvantage on **STR** and **NIM** tests, and you cannot take **Vanguard** stance.
- If you are Injured and you gain another injury: you drop to **0 Stamina** immediately (taken out). Whether you die, are carried off, or are saved becomes the scene’s stake.

**Healing Injuries (slow):** an Injury does not clear on a short rest. It clears after a Companionship Phase **Healing Rest** undertaking, or after a true sanctuary recovery (healer’s hall, long rest in safety).

### Companionship Phase (downtime undertakings)
After a completed adventure, each PC picks **one** undertaking:

| Undertaking | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Healing Rest** | Clear all Fatigue and recover **+1 Hope token** |
| **Research Lore** | Ask the Lorekeeper one lore question; if it touches the Dread, mark **+1 Dread** |
| **Craft / Repair** | For the next adventure, one weapon/tool gains **+1 edge** (does not stack; cap edge at **+2**) |
| **Strengthen Bonds** | Restore **+1 Companionship token** (up to the starting maximum) |

### Tainted & Sanctuary Ground
- **Tainted** (old battlefield, tomb‑hill): each night spent here → mark **+1 Dread**.
- **Sanctuary** (peaceful haven, holy hall): the first full night clears **1 Dread** and **1 Fatigue** for each PC.

Travel choices acquire moral weight.

## WRITING IN NORTHLAND SAGA STYLE
![](../assets/art/ss_twilight_road_lantern.png){.wrap-right width=1.25in trim="418bp 204bp 403bp 206bp"}

- **Elevate but stay clear.** Plain words, with occasional high diction (“ere”, “fell”, “lo”).
- **Landscape as character.** Heather, hush of pines, stars wheeling above a ruined watch‑hill.
- **Hope amid sorrow.** Even bleak moments hold a glimmer: thrush‑song, warm bread, a shared jest.
- **Songs & lineage.** A couplet; a remembered name (“daughter of the river‑wardens”).
- **Sudden turns.** Peril reaches darkest pitch, then a sharp reversal — dawnlight, a horn, unexpected mercy.

### Lorekeeper’s Desk — extra advice
- **Season the calendar.** Harvest moons, first frosts, the memory of a fell winter.
- **Let names carry history.** “This blade was forged before the kingdom broke.”
- **Reward clever combat.** One giant > five raiders. Flooded ford, flaming brand, falling stones.
- **Dread is a choice engine.** Offer treasure with a whisper; offer redemption by renunciation.
- **Weather is drama.** A watch‑hill squall can impose Disadvantage on missile fire or swell Fatigue — no monster needed.

---

## SIDEBAR: HEARTHLANDS‑ONLY ADVENTURE

For bright‑toned hearthlands games, replace Dread with **Mischief** (a 0–5 Pressure track).

- At **5**, the crisis is a visit from the village wardens (or an angry landholder), then reset Mischief to **0**.
- Travels are day‑trips; Fatigue is usually trivial.
- Fatal weapons are off the table; the worst dangers are floods, feuds, and foolishness.

Knack seeds: *Second Snack* (once per session clear 1 Fatigue with a meal) • *Curious Heart* (once per scene ask the Lorekeeper for a harmless clue).

---

## LOREKEEPER’S MOVES

- **Opening beat:** old road patrol finds a black feather; a harvest contest turns strange; a lantern is seen at a tomb‑mouth.
- **Moves:** distant wolf howl • red star over the watch‑hill • beacon flare • chilling tomb breeze • a grey traveller’s warning.
- **Pacing:** one lore clue, one peril, one respite — repeat. Dread rises fastest when greed tempts or courage fails.

> “A single yellow lantern danced in a crossroads inn‑gate, like hope holding vigil.”
