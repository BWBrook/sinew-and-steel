# **SERVICE DUCT BLUES**
### Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*Life below decks on a frontier starship, starbase, or deep‑space platform, Shift 17—.*

_(Paste atop the Sinew & Steel rules; anything not listed here follows the core.)_

Service Duct Blues is lower‑decks starship drama: miracles under deadlines, competence under scrutiny, and optimism under stress.
Expect coolant leaks, anomalous readings, personal frictions, and episodes where the real victory is keeping everyone alive (and keeping the ship’s conscience intact).

Suggested creation tone: **standard** (**6** build points).

**Micro‑vignette (cold open):**

> The deck plates hum under your palms. A warning chime tries to sound polite. Somewhere above, Command stays calm — and expects you to do the same.

## CREW TRAINING (Adventurer)

| Core slot | Crew label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Muscle (MSC)** | heaving manifolds, restraining a panicked crewmate, hard climbs |
| Reflex | **Reflex (REF)** | EVA manoeuvres, duct crawls, quick reroute taps |
| Intellect | **Systems (SYS)** | diagnostics, reactor theory, programming, sensor reads |
| Empathy | **Harmony (HAR)** | morale boosts, mediation, reading subtext under stress |
| Luck | **Resourcefulness (RES)** | miracle fixes **and** token pool |

**Rules reminder:** natural **1** is best; natural **20** is worst (and cannot be nudged).

### Resourcefulness (Luck) flavour
Tokens are battered **emergency chits** in a pocket case.

When the Custodian calls for blind chance — “**Test your Resourcefulness**!” — roll under your **current chits** (not your maximum).
Spend chits now to nudge rolls, but remember: fewer tokens means shakier Resourcefulness later.

A short rest in quarters or the mess restores **+1 chit**; a focus drill or strong coffee may restore more.

### Tools & Edges
| Tool / Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Engineering kit bash, stun baton | 0 |
| Beam sidearm (stun), torque wrench | +1 |
| Beam sidearm (lethal), micro‑cutter | +2 |

*(Safety regs: going lethal in a crowded corridor marks **+1 Stress** automatically.)*

### Uniform & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Duty coveralls (with field‑weave) | 1 |
| Tactical vest | 2 |
| Personal shield belt | 3 |

(Dynamic soak: after a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points** of attacker margin; **nat 1 pierces all**.)

### Operations
* **“Reroute!”** — once per scene declare a systems miracle; spend **1 RES** for Advantage on a SYS roll that patches power, re‑phases a shield segment, isolates a leak, etc.
* **“Technobabble Buffer.”** Spend **2 RES** after a failed SYS roll to delay the consequence by one beat (gives the team time to react).
  - If the problem still isn’t resolved by the next scene, mark **+1 Stress** and the delayed consequence lands.

* **Cross‑Training Override** *(once per scene)*
You’ve done time in other departments. Say which one, then take Advantage on the roll.

| Department | Gain Advantage on… | Narrative perk | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ops / Security** | MSC and REF tests to restrain, firefight, EVA repair | A locker sidearm is “conveniently nearby.” | **1 RES** *or* +1 Stress |
| **Research / Medical** | SYS (analysis) or HAR (triage) | Custodian must reveal one hard data point about the anomaly. | 1 RES *or* +1 Stress |
| **Command / Flight** | HAR (orders) or SYS (helm, shuttle) | You may shift **1 Stress** from yourself to the ship’s alert status (narrative only). | 1 RES *or* +1 Stress |

*Limits:* only one override per scene; can’t override at Stress 4 if out of RES.

### Scanner Protocol
| Mode | How to use | What you get | Cost / Risk |
|------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Quick Scan** | Test **SYS** with Advantage | One concrete data point | none |
| **Deep Scan** *(once per scene)* | Spend **1 RES** *or* mark **+1 Stress**, test SYS (normal) | Ask two yes/no questions the Custodian must answer truthfully | cost above |
| **Overload Push** | If you roll a natural **20** on a scan (worst), you may spend **2 RES** to salvage a partial reading | Avoid total failure; the scanner fries until repaired (simple SYS) | 2 RES & device offline |

> (Safety regs: bypassing sensor interlocks without authorisation marks **+1 Stress**.)

### The other 99% (crew roles)
This skin is about the people who keep the ship alive while senior officers make speeches.
Rotate spotlight scenes across departments so “ship life” feels broad and lived‑in.

- **Science specialist (lab / survey)** — you turn chaos into data. Default approach: **SYS** (analysis) and **HAR** (ethics, persuasion, de‑escalation). Ask for clean procedures.
- **Medical tech (sickbay / triage)** — you keep people breathing. Default approach: **HAR** (triage, bedside), sometimes **SYS** (diagnostics). Let failure mean hard choices, not “no healing.”
- **Security / Ops crew (corridors / brig / away team)** — you keep order without becoming the villain. Default approach: **REF** (cover, timing), **MSC** (restraint), **HAR** (talk someone down).
- **Shuttle / flight deck** — you survive docking, debris, and crossfire. Default approach: **SYS** (helm, nav) and **REF** (evasive timing).
- **Service crew (mess / hydroponics / quarters)** — you keep morale and routines intact. Default approach: **HAR** (crew cohesion) with **RES** when supply lines fail.

## COMPUTER SYSTEMS (Showrunner Notes — Custodian)

### **Stress** Track (Pressure skin)
Stress is shipboard pressure. It runs **0–5**; at **5** trigger a crisis, then reset Stress to **0**.

| Step | Status hue | Shipboard effect |
|--|--|--|
|0|Blue‑calm|—|
|1|Green blip|cosmetic: warning chimes, flickering panels|
|2|Yellow|Disadvantage on time‑sensitive repairs|
|3|Orange|section lockdowns, NPC suspicion|
|4|High alert|each **risky test** costs **1 RES** (spend before rolling) or marks **+1 Stress**; senior staff glare|
|5 **Crisis**|Breach klaxon|roll Stress crisis, reset to **0**|

_(A risky test is any roll where failure would materially change the situation: injuries, disciplinary fallout, alarms, lockdowns, or escalating danger. Routine movement and obvious chores need no roll.)_

**Gain Stress:** failed covert repairs, sidearm discharge in public corridors, ignoring safety interlocks, “Technobabble Buffer” overrun.  
**Reduce:** shore leave, commendation, spotless inspection.

**Crisis table (d6)**

| d6 | Crisis |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Reactor cascade — EVA scramble or emergency vent |
| 2 | Containment loss — radiation burns: lose **1 STM** if you’re in the section |
| 3 | Safety inquiry — Disadv social with command next session |
| 4 | Nanite alarm — SYS roll or lose a key system |
| 5 | Shipwide lockdown — travel restricted, timers tick |
| 6 | Roll twice; apply both |

#### Showrunner Notes (Custodian) — Writing an Optimistic Space Episode

1. **Cold‑open hook (≤ 150 words).** A duct conduit ruptures, a quantum echo hums, or an irate passenger demands a plasma shower. End on the breach klaxon.
2. **A‑/B‑plot rhythm.** Keep one technical crisis (grid overload) and one interpersonal thread (crew rivalry, a debt, a secret). Alternate scenes.
3. **Dialogue first, dice second.** Let players propose plans; only roll when the grid might blow or a superior officer remains unconvinced.
4. **Optimism with friction.** No grimdark — conflict is creative, not cruel. Even an antagonist might want out.
5. **Montage beat.** Use one Systems roll plus Cross‑Training Override to cover bypass‑reroute‑weld sequences; summarise sparks on bulkheads, sweat on brows.
6. **Act‑break cliffhangers.** Every 4–6 beats hit: *“Reactor breach in 120 seconds”* or *“Captain on comm: ‘Ensign, explain the sidearm discharge in Shuttle Bay 2.’”*
7. **Stinger epilogue.** Show the repaired conduit humming; crew share ration‑pie in the mess; one faint chirp hints at next episode.

> *“The coolant flow stabilises, lights returning to cool blue. Ortiz exhales — then a proximity klaxon screams. Something massive drops in‑system right atop their vector…”*

Roll opening credits.

**Spotlight the other 99% (episode anchors):**
- A lab result that contradicts Command’s assumptions (and forces a moral choice).
- A sickbay scene where “stun” still means burns, bruises, and fear.
- An away team escort who realises the sidearm is the least useful tool they brought.
- A mess‑hall argument that becomes a quiet pact — and saves the ship later.

### Shipboard flavour bullets
* Coolant lines hum like distant thunder.  
* Medbay monitors pulse soft green over exhausted faces.  
* Corridor air tastes of ozone and burnt peach.  
* A single annunciator chirp can still hearts across ten decks.

### Custodian Moves
Power surge shorts a duct node • Coolant leak clouds maintenance bay • Medbay monitor fails mid‑triage • Lab containment field flickers • Away team loses comms • Captain on comm: “I need that grid stable in three minutes, ensign.”

### Beat tags
Label nodes by deck/section: ENG‑D4, SCI‑B2, MED‑C1, SHBAY‑2, DUCT‑J19, AWAY‑01.

This skin does **not** rewind. If you want a safety valve, use **logs** as clues: sensor records and captain’s reports might reveal what happened.

### Scene seed

> *The ship shudders as a gravimetric shear slams the hull. In Junction J‑19 steam hisses from a ruptured conduit; crimson strobes wash the crawl‑tube walls. Talara’s scanner whines — grid flow spiking. Ortiz wipes condensation from his brow, voice tight over comms.*

> Options:
> 1. Close the manual cutoff — risk flash‑burn on a Muscle roll.
> 2. Crawl deeper, hoping to reach the primary junction (Reflex).
> 3. Bypass power through a jury‑rigged phase inverter (Systems, Adv if you spend “Reroute!”).
> 4. Get everyone on the same page over comms — calm, coordinate, and keep the room from panicking (Harmony).

*—How will the lower decks save the upper?*
