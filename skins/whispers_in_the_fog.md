# **WHISPERS IN THE FOG**
### Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system

![](../assets/covers/ss_logo_whispers_in_the_fog.png){.wrap-right width=0.45in}

*Mournful New‑England shores, 1924. Gas‑lamps gutter, marsh‑mists coil, and nameless shapes lurk just beyond the churchyard wall.*

_(Paste atop the Sinew & Steel rules; anything not listed here follows the core.)_

Whispers in the Fog is weird‑horror investigation: frail lantern‑light, forbidden books, polite conversations that turn sour, and truths that do not fit inside a human skull.
Expect foreboding that rises by inches, sudden violence, and answers that feel like bargains.

Suggested creation tone: **standard** (**6** build points) — capable investigators, fragile minds.

In this skin, the Custodian is often called the **Keeper**.

**Micro‑vignette (cold open):**

> The fog comes in like a living thing, as though the sea is exhaling. A buoy bell rings where it should not. Your lantern’s glass is filmed with salt — and something else.

## INQUIRER’S NOTES (Adventurer)

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Whispers label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Vigor (VIG)** | brawling, forced doors, sprinting across wharfs |
| Reflex | **Agility (AGI)** | stealth, quick‑draw, nimble escapes |
| Intellect | **Scholarship (SCH)** | research, cryptography, forbidden rites |
| Empathy | **Fortitude (FRT)** | composure, persuasion, mental resilience |
| Luck | **Fate (FAT)** | uncanny chance **and** token pool |

**Rules reminder:** natural **1** is best; natural **20** is worst (and cannot be nudged).

### Fate (Luck) tokens
Tokens are yellowed ferry tickets kept in a silver case.

When the Custodian calls for blind chance — “**Test your Fate**!” — roll under your **current tickets** (not your maximum).
Spend tickets now to nudge rolls, but remember: fewer tickets means shakier Fate later.

A short rest in safety restores **+1 ticket**; opium dreams or saintly relics may restore more.

## ELDRITCH RITES
![](../assets/art/ss_whispers_forbidden_tome.png){.margin-right width=0.95in trim="0.15in 0.15in 0.15in 0.15in"}

> *Spells and rituals are named effects tagged to a tier on discovery.*

| Tier | Cast with | On **success** | On **failure** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Whisper** | SCH | no cost | no cost |
| **Rite** | SCH | choose 1: spend **1 Fate ticket** *or* mark **+1 Insanity** | mark **+1 Insanity** |
| **Invocation** | SCH (**Fate cannot aid**) | mark **+1 Insanity** anyway | mark **+2 Insanity** and Custodian backlash |
| **Unspeakable** | SCH (**Fate cannot aid**) | the effect manifests (natural **1** = legend) | backlash **and** roll an Insanity crisis immediately (reset to **0**) |

*Example learns:* “Sign of Drowning — Rite (SCH)”, “Void‑Spawn Banishment — Invocation (SCH)”.

**Unspeakable procedure:** mark **+2 Insanity**, then roll. On a natural **20**, the void answers (Keeper describes the worst plausible consequence).

## INSANITY TRACK (Pressure skin)
![](../assets/art/ss_whispers_insanity_spiral.png){.margin-right width=0.95in trim="0.15in 0.15in 0.15in 0.15in"}

Insanity is mental pressure. It runs **0–5**; at **5** you **Break**, trigger a crisis, then reset Insanity to **0**.
The mind forgets the count; it does not forget the scar.

| Step | Manifestation | Effect |
|--|--|--|
|0|Steady|—|
|1|Agitation|cosmetic tremor, whispered tinnitus |
|2|Deep unease|Disadvantage on your next **FRT** test to resist fear or coercion |
|3|Fracture|Each **risky test** costs **1 Fate ticket** (spend before rolling) or marks **+1 Insanity** |
|4|Night terrors|Disadvantage on all tests |
|5 **Break (Crisis)**|Psychotic episode / possession|Roll Insanity crisis, reset to **0** |

_(A risky test is any roll where failure would materially change the situation: harm, loss, exposure, separation. Routine travel and careful talk need no roll.)_

**Gain Insanity:** witnessing gore or cosmic horrors, failed rites, reading forbidden tomes.  
**Purge:** a month in a sanitarium, costly hypnosis (spend **2 Fate tickets**), or a grounding ritual (marriage, Mass, a sober confession to someone you trust).

**Insanity crisis (d6)**

| d6 | Crisis |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Black‑out violence — you awaken holding a bloodied object (lose **1 STM**) |
| 2 | Catalepsy — helpless for one scene |
| 3 | Desolate vision — Disadvantage on all rolls next session |
| 4 | Whispered truth — gain one crucial rumour clue; your next rest restores **no Fate** |
| 5 | Public hysteria — NPCs fear or shun you; Disadvantage on **FRT** tests in polite society until resolved |
| 6 | Roll twice; apply both |

## KNACKS (pick one)
Each use costs: **spend 1 Fate ticket** or **mark +1 Insanity**.

| Knack | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Occult Scholar** | Once per scene, turn a library/tomes search into an Advantage **SCH** test. |
| **Detective Intuition** | Spend **1 Fate ticket** to ask the Custodian (Keeper) one yes/no clue question. |
| **Veteran’s Nerves** | Once per scene, ignore an incoming **+1 Insanity** tick. |
| **Silver Tongue** | Advantage on your first **FRT** (social) test with any new NPC. |

### Optional Expertise (choose one stat)
Choose one stat as **Expertise** (marksman = AGI, doctor = SCH). When the task squarely fits, roll with Advantage.

## GEAR & TAGS

| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Blackjack, pocket‑knife | 0 |
| .38 revolver, brass knuckles | +1 |
| Coach gun (shotgun, close) | +2 |

**Fatal tag (example):** point‑blank shotgun blast on a helpless target — **Fatal (counter: hard cover)**.

| Wearable | Soak |
|---|---|
| Woollen coat | 0 |
| WWI flak vest | 1 |

(Dynamic soak: after a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points** of attacker margin; **nat 1 pierces all**.)

> *“Somewhere beneath the hymn of the surf, a deeper cadence throbbed… like the slowed heart of a behemoth dreaming in pitch.”*

### Lantern & Battery (light tension, core‑aligned)
![](../assets/art/ss_whispers_fog_lantern.png){.wrap-right width=1.25in trim="0.15in 0.15in 0.15in 0.15in"}

In this genre, light is safety. Darkness is a weapon.
To keep resource tension without extra dice systems, track portable light as a small **clock**.

- **Create a clock:** “Lantern” or “Battery” (default **4 ticks**).
- **Tick it** when light is stressed: knocked, doused, long exploration, running, fighting, thick fog, frantic climbing.
- At **3/4**, the beam gutters: apply Disadvantage to the next **AGI** test that depends on sight.
- At **4/4**, the light dies: mark **+1 Insanity** (fear spike) and play the next beat in darkness until a new light is lit.
- Fresh fuel/batteries reset the clock to **0** in a safe moment.

Keeper guidance: you may keep the light clock **public** (for planning) or **hidden** (for suspense). If hidden, telegraph it with flickers, smells of hot filament, or the oil’s last sputter.

> *“A lantern swung in the fog, tracing impossible angles—yet each swing returned to the same ghastly intersection of shadow.”*

## KEEPER’S QUILL (Custodian)

### Writing in weird‑horror tone
- **Use archaisms sparingly.** One archaic verb per paragraph (‘betokened’, ‘antediluvian’) is perfume; a whole bouquet is parody.
- **Layer sensory unease.** Sight‑smells‑sounds in quick succession: “salt‑reek, pulsing lavender glow, distant surf that pounded like vast respirations.”
- **Imply the shape, deny the whole.** Describe edges, textures, odours — never the full anatomy of the horror. Let the cortex finish the sketch.
- **Cosmic scale through comparison.** “Its shadow swallowed the lighthouse as a gull swallows a grain of sand.”
- **Use fragile narrators.** PCs mutter doubt, stumble on diction: ellipses, dashes, unfinished clauses mirror fraying psyche.
- **Slow verbs, sudden violence.** Ten lines of oppressive hush, then one splintering gunshot or roof‑beam collapse.
- **Finish scenes with foreboding, not triumph.** Even victories taste of spoiled brine and scorched vellum.
- **Let knowledge hurt.** Reward Scholarship with answers that cost sanity; each new fact should feel like a bargain struck at midnight.

> *“In the ledger’s margin, the ink had crusted to a curious verdigris, as though the word itself resented daylight.”*

---

### Flavour Palette (Keeper cues)
- **Sights:** fog halos the gas‑lamps; moonlit marsh reeds sway like skeletal fingers.
- **Sounds:** distant buoy bell, wet slither beneath floorboards, a church clock that skips the chime for two o’clock.
- **Smells:** brackish tide‑mud, old books stained with vinegar, acrid cordite lingering after a single shot.

**Keeper moves:**  
- Church bell tolls backwards • Tidal surge floods cellar steps • Cultist chant echoes from crypt • A thin crack opens in the sky, showing alien stars.

---

### Episode Structure (one‑shot model)

1. **Cold open.** Newspaper clipping or funeral sets the hook.  
2. **Investigation web.** Three core locales (abandoned church, docks, upland woods).  
3. **Rising unease.** Each locale threatens Insanity or physical harm.  
4. **Clock.** Run a 4–6 tick clock: “Ritual at Midnight” (or “The Tide Turns”).  
5. **Finale.** Banishment rite, dynamite collapse, or escape while the ancient thing feeds.  
6. **Aftermath.** Survivors scarred; reputations tattered.

Stylistic rule: pain is concrete, hope is whispered, knowledge always costs.

> *“Knowledge is not a ladder but a pit; one descends, rung by foolish rung, until the sky is a memory.”*
