# **JEFFRIES-TUBE BLUES**
## Skin add-on for the Sinew & Steel game system
*Life below decks on an Alpha‑Quadrant starship, starbase, or station, Stardate 47—.*

_(Paste atop the Sinew & Steel rules; anything not listed here follows the core.)_

Jeffries‑Tube Blues is lower‑decks Starfleet drama: miracles under deadlines, competence under scrutiny, and optimism under stress.
Expect plasma leaks, anomalous readings, personal frictions, and episodes where the real victory is keeping everyone alive (and keeping the ship’s conscience intact).

Suggested creation tone: **standard** (**6** build points).

**Micro‑vignette (cold open):**
> The deck plates hum under your palms. A warning chime tries to sound polite. Somewhere above, the bridge stays calm — and expects you to do the same.

## 🛠️ STARFLEET TRAINING (Adventurer)

| Core slot | Starfleet label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Muscle (MSC)** | heaving plasma manifolds, hand‑to‑hand shoves |
| Reflex | **Reflex (REF)** | EVA manoeuvres, Jeffries crawl, quick reroute taps |
| Intellect | **Systems (SYS)** | diagnostics, warp theory, programming, tricorder scans |
| Empathy | **Harmony (HAR)** | morale boosts, mediation, reading alien subtext |
| Luck | **Resourcefulness (RES)** | miracle fixes **and** token pool |

**Rules reminder:** natural **1** is best; natural **20** is worst (and cannot be nudged).

### Resourcefulness (Luck) flavour
Tokens are colour‑coded iso‑linears in a pocket case.

When the Custodian calls for blind chance — “**Test your Resourcefulness**!” — roll under your **current iso‑linears** (not your maximum).
Spend iso‑linears now to nudge rolls, but remember: fewer tokens means shakier Resourcefulness later.

A short rest in quarters or the mess restores **+1 iso‑linear**; Vulcan meditation or replicated raktajino may restore more.

### Tools & Edges  
| Tool / Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Engineering kit bash, stun baton | 0 |
| Type-1 phaser (stun), hyperspanner torque | +1 |
| Type-2 phaser (stun/kill), micro-torque laser | +2 |

*(Starfleet regs: lethal setting marks **+1 Stress** automatically.)*

### Uniform & Soak  
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Duty uniform (with force-field weave) | 1 |
| Tactical vest | 2 |
| Personal energy shield (PES) | 3 |

(Dynamic soak: after a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points** of attacker margin; **nat 1 pierces all**.)

### Operations  
* **“Reroute!”** — once per scene declare a systems miracle; spend **1 RES** for Advantage on a SYS roll that patches power, re-phases shields, etc.  
* **“Technobabble Buffer.”** Spend **2 RES** after a failed SYS roll to delay the consequence by one beat (gives the team time to react).
  - If the problem still isn’t resolved by the next scene, mark **+1 Stress** and the delayed consequence lands.

* **Division Override** *(once per scene)*  
Thumb-twist your combadge stripe to another division colour.

| Stripe chosen | Gain Advantage on… | Narrative perk | Cost |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------|------|
| **Gold – Ops / Security** | Muscle **or** Reflex rolls to restrain, firefight, EVA repair | Security-locker phaser type-1 is “conveniently nearby.” | **1 RES** *or* +1 Stress |
| **Blue – Science / Medical** | Systems (analysis) **or** Harmony (triage) | Custodian must reveal one hard data point about the anomaly. | 1 RES *or* +1 Stress |
| **Red – Command / Flight** | Harmony (orders) **or** Systems (helm, shuttle) | You may shift 1 Stress from yourself to the ship’s alert status (narrative only). | 1 RES *or* +1 Stress |

*Limits:* only one flip per scene; can’t flip at Stress 4 if out of RES.

### Tricorder Protocol  
| Mode | How to use | What you get | Cost / Risk |
|------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Quick Scan** | Test **SYS** with Advantage | One concrete data point | none |
| **Deep Scan** *(once per scene)* | Spend **1 RES** *or* mark **+1 Stress**, test SYS (normal) | Ask two yes/no questions the Custodian must answer truthfully | cost above |
| **Overload Push** | If you roll a natural **20** on a scan (worst), you may spend **2 RES** to salvage a partial reading | Avoid total failure; tricorder fries until repaired (simple SYS) | 2 RES & device offline |

>(Starfleet regs: modifying sensor interlocks without authorisation marks **+1 Stress**.)

### The other 99% (crew roles)
This skin is about the people who keep the ship alive while the bridge makes speeches.
If you want it to feel like “Star Trek, but from below decks,” rotate spotlight scenes across departments.

- **Science specialist (lab / survey)** — you turn chaos into data. Default approach: **SYS** (analysis) and **HAR** (ethics, persuasion, de‑escalation). Use tricorder protocols and ask for clean procedures.
- **Medical tech (sickbay / triage)** — you keep people breathing. Default approach: **HAR** (triage, bedside), sometimes **SYS** (diagnostics). Let failure mean hard choices, not “no healing.”
- **Security / Ops crew (corridors / brig / away team)** — you keep order without becoming the villain. Default approach: **REF** (cover, timing), **MSC** (restraint), **HAR** (talk someone down).
- **Shuttle / flight deck** — you survive docking, debris, and crossfire. Default approach: **SYS** (helm, nav) and **REF** (evasive timing).
- **Service crew (mess / hydroponics / quarters)** — you keep morale and routines intact. Default approach: **HAR** (crew cohesion) with **RES** when supply lines fail.

## ⚠️ COMPUTER SYSTEMS (Showrunner Notes — Custodian)

### **Stress** Track (Pressure skin)
Stress is shipboard pressure. It runs **0–5**; at **5** trigger a crisis, then reset Stress to **0**.

| Step | LCARS hue | Shipboard effect |
|--|--|--|
|0|Blue-calm|—|
|1|Green blip|Cosmetic: warning chimes|
|2|Yellow|Disadvantage on time-sensitive repairs|
|3|Orange|Section lockdowns, NPC suspicion|
|4|Red alert|Each **risky test** costs **1 RES** (spend before rolling) or marks **+1 Stress**; senior staff glare|
|5 **Crisis**|Breach klaxon|Roll Stress crisis, reset 0|

_(A risky test is any roll where failure would materially change the situation: injuries, disciplinary fallout, alarms, lockdowns, or escalating danger. Routine movement and obvious chores need no roll.)_

**Gain Stress:** failed covert repairs, phaser fire in public corridors, ignoring safety interlocks, “Technobabble Buffer” overrun.  
**Reduce:** shore leave, captain’s commendation, spotless inspection.

**Crisis table (d6)**  
1 Warp core cascade—EVA scramble or eject core  
2 Containment loss—radiation damage 1 STM to all in section  
3 JAG inquiry—Disadv social with command next session  
4 Borg nanite alarm—SYS roll or lose key system  
5 Shipwide lockdown—travel restricted, timers tick  
6 Roll twice; apply both

#### Showrunner Notes (Custodian) — Writing a Trek‑Era Episode  

1. **Cold-open hook (≤ 150 words).**  A Jeffries conduit ruptures, a quantum echo hums, or an irate Bolian demands a plasma shower.  End on the red‑alert klaxon.  
2. **A-/B-plot rhythm.**  Keep one technical crisis (EPS overload) and one interpersonal thread (crewman’s secret holonovel).  Alternate scenes.  
3. **Dialogue first, dice second.**  Let players technobabble a plan; only roll when the core might blow or a superior officer remains unconvinced.  
4. **Roddenberry optimism with friction.**  No grimdark — conflict is creative, not cruel. Even the Borg drone may seek liberation.  
5. **Montage beat.**  Use a single Systems roll plus Division Override to cover bypass-reroute-weld sequences; summarise sparks on bulkheads, sweat on brows.  
6. **Act-break cliffhangers.**  Every 4–6 beats hit: *“Warp core breach in 120 seconds”* or *“Captain on comm: ‘Ensign, explain the phaser discharge in Shuttle Bay 2.’”*  
7. **Stinger epilogue.**  Show the repaired conduit humming; crew share replicated pie in the mess; one faint LCARS chirp hints at next episode.

> *“The plasma flow stabilises, lights returning to cool blue.  Ortiz exhales — then a proximity klaxon screams. Something massive drops from warp right atop their vector…”*  

Roll opening credits.

**Spotlight the other 99% (episode anchors):**
- A lab result that contradicts the bridge’s assumptions (and forces a moral choice).
- A sickbay scene where “stun” still means burns, bruises, and fear.
- An away team escort who realises the phaser is the least useful tool they brought.
- A mess‑hall argument that becomes a quiet pact — and saves the ship later.

### Shipboard flavour bullets  
* Plasma conduits hum like distant thunder.  
* Biobed monitors pulse soft green over exhausted faces.  
* Corridor air tastes of ozone and burnt peach.  
* A single annunciator chirp can still hearts across ten decks.

### Custodian Moves  
Power surge shorts Jeffries node • Plasma leak clouds maintenance bay • Biobed fails mid‑triage • Lab containment field flickers • Away team loses comms • Captain on comm: “I need that EPS grid in three minutes, ensign.”

### Beat tags  
Label nodes by deck/section: ENG‑D4, SCI‑B2, MED‑C1, SHBAY‑2, TUBE‑J19, AWAY‑01.

This skin does **not** rewind. If you want a safety valve, use **logs** as clues: sensor records and captain’s reports might reveal what happened.

### Scene seed  

> *The ship shudders as a gravimetric shear slams the hull.  In Junction J-19 steam hisses from a ruptured conduit; crimson alert strobes wash the crawl-tube walls.  T’Lara’s tricorder whines—EPS flow spiking.  Ortiz wipes condensation from his brow, voice tight over comms.*  

> Options:  
> 1. Close the manual cutoff—risk flash-burn on a Muscle roll.  
> 2. Crawl deeper, hoping to reach the primary junction (Reflex).  
> 3. Bypass power through a jury-rigged phase inverter (Systems, Adv if you spend “Reroute!”).  
> 4. Get everyone on the same page over comms — calm, coordinate, and keep the room from panicking (Harmony).

*—How will the lower decks save the upper bridge?*
