*Grim sword‑and‑sorcery in the spirit of pulp adventure.*

_(Layer atop the universal rules; anything unstated defaults to core.)_

Iron & Ruin is a tale of iron and ash: barbarian courage, decadent cities, and sorcery that always exacts a price.
Heroes can defy fate — but the gods, the cults, and the old powers keep ledgers.

Suggested creation tone: **pulp** (**12** build points) fits the genre well.

## SCROLL OF GRIM TALES (Adventurer)

### Attribute Labels
| Core slot | Iron & Ruin label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **Brawn (BRN)** | raw strength, ferocity, melee power |
| Reflex | **Agility (AGI)** | speed, balance, tumbling |
| Intellect | **Cunning (CUN)** | stealth, guile, precision |
| Empathy | **Will (WIL)** | grit vs fear, mental steel, sorcery control |
| Luck | **Fortune (FOR)** | whim of the gods & token pool |

### Fortune Pool flavour
Tokens = wolf‑tooth talismans.

When the Custodian calls for pure chance — “**Test your Fortune**!” — roll under your **current tokens**.
A rest by a safe hearth restores **+1 token**; priestly blessings or stolen relics may restore more.

**Rules reminder:** natural **1** is best; natural **20** is worst (and cannot be nudged).

### Weapons & Edges
| Weapon | Edge |
|---|---|
| Fist, cudgel | 0 |
| Broadsword, war‑axe, short bow | +1 |
| Greatsword, long bow, sorcerous bolt | +2 |

Fists and blackjacks are usually non-lethal: at **0 STM** the target is out cold unless you choose otherwise (or the fiction demands worse).

### Armour & Soak
| Protection | Soak |
|---|---|
| Leather jerkin | 1 |
| Ring mail / hide coat | 2 |
| Steel plate & shield | 3 |

(Dynamic soak: after a hit, reduce soak by **1 per full 4 points** of attacker margin; **nat 1 pierces all**.)

A draught of wine by the fire restores **+1 STM** after a calm scene; a full bed and ministrations restores **+2** (never above max).
Severe wounds need a healer’s skill, potent herbs, or time.

### Equipment & Burden
A character may carry up to six substantial items — armour, weapons, bundles, or large tools. Trinkets and small gear ride in pouches and don’t count against the limit.
Coin is an inconvenient necessity; carry too much, and brigands will smell it.

### Sorcery
![](../assets/art/ss_iron_ruin_sorcery_tiers.png){.margin-right width=0.95in trim="409bp 341bp 371bp 246bp"}

Steel is trustworthy; spells are treacherous. Any feat is *theoretically* possible, but risk scales brutally.

| Tier | Example intent | Roll | Cost on **success** | Cost on **failure** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Whisper** | Spark a torch, seal a minor wound, chill wine | Test WIL | none | fizzles (no Doom) |
| **Weave** | Hurl a flame bolt, cloud a guard’s mind, walk unseen a heartbeat | Test WIL; you may spend Fortune to nudge | choose **1:** <br>• spend **1 Fortune** <br>• or lose **1 STM** | **+1 Doom** |
| **Wrack** | Shatter iron gates, summon shadow hound, freeze a river ford | Test WIL (no Fortune nudges) | **+1 Doom** *even on success* | **+2 Doom** *and* a backlash (Custodian chooses or roll) |
| **Wyrd** | Rewrite the memory of a city, call a storm‑god’s spear | Automatic **+3 Doom**, then Test WIL; nat 1 = legend; any fail = Custodian’s worst | success: tale echoes for ages | immediate backlash (table) |

#### Backlash table (d6)

1 Flesh withers (–1 STM)  
2 Possessed by minor demon one scene  
3 Blind for a day; third eye opens at night (+Adv on sorcery)  
4 Nearest ally gains +1 Doom with you  
5 Eldritch mark: foes sense you; Disadv stealth until purged  
6 Roll twice (stack)

#### Casting steps

1. Declare the effect and its **Tier**.  
2. Test **WIL** (unless the tier is Wyrd) and apply Fortune nudges if allowed.  
3. Apply costs and consequences from table.  
4. Narrate untamed fallout; increase Doom track as required.

**Rules of thumb**

* Whisper = cantrips; costs nothing but time.  
* Weave = combat tricks; Fortune or blood can power them.  
* Wrack = story shakers; even success scars the soul.  
* Wyrd = campaign‑level sorcery; Doom will bite and history will buckle.

Natural 1 pierces all soak and doubles narrative punch. Natural 20 jumps to the “fail” column; the Custodian may add **+1 Doom** if it fits the bargain.

_Sorcery is a bargain with things that do not love you. Spend Doom like coin, but remember the debt collector always comes before dawn._

### **Doom** (Pressure track)
![](../assets/art/ss_iron_ruin_doom_sigils.png){.margin-right width=0.95in trim="313bp 262bp 284bp 253bp"}

Doom is the Pressure track for this skin: the shadow of magic and the debt of the unseen.
The sorcery tier table tells you exactly when Doom rises; as a rule of thumb, **most failed sorcery adds +1 Doom**, and stronger workings can add Doom even on success.

| Step | Portent | Custodian twist |
|--|--|--|
|0|Calm|—|
|1|Whispers|cosmetic omens|
|2|Blood sigils|minor Disadvantage|
|3|Mind tremor|NPC fear, rituals cost +1 Fortune|
|4|Veil thins|environment warps, +1 damage from sorcery backlash|
|5 Backlash|Possession / Withering|Trigger Doom Crisis, reset to **0**|

Doom purge: cleric rite, sacrificial pyre, or grim personal cost.

**Doom crisis (d6)**

| d6 | Crisis |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Demon grip — lose control one scene |
| 2 | Soul scar — -1 STM & gain eerie stigma |
| 3 | Eldritch eruption — area damage |
| 4 | Mind shatter — Disadv all rolls next session |
| 5 | Curse brand — foes scent you across leagues |
| 6 | Roll twice. |

### Totemic Feats
Once per session declare a **Heroic Act**: attempt a cinematic stunt (kick from battlements, snap a chain, cut a rope bridge at the right moment).
Gain **Advantage**. If you succeed, you may either add **+1 edge** to the action’s harm or inflict a simple status (disarmed, stunned, driven back).
Cost: **1 Fortune**.

> *Ready your steel. The world kneels only to those who dare carve their saga.*

## CHRONICLER'S TOUCHSTONE (Custodian)

### Narrative Rhythm
![](../assets/art/ss_iron_ruin_idol.png){.wrap-right width=1.15in trim="350bp 118bp 329bp 104bp"}

Terse, muscular prose. Violence sudden; sorcery foul or uncanny. Civilisation decadent; heroes carve fate. Cursed sigils, rival factions, prophetic dreams.

**Micro‑vignette (frame a beat):**

> The idol’s eyes are rubies. The chamber reeks of old incense and newer blood. Somewhere beyond the lintel, a priest begins to chant your name.

Keep rolls sparse; heroes triumph more than they fail, yet peril must feel real. Use Advantage to reward cunning gambits, Disadvantage to punish hubris. Fortune is precious—recover it slowly so its last flickers feel desperate. Hand out Doom sparingly but make its consequences unforgettable. Milestones should follow story logic, not arithmetic.

### Storyteller's Primer
The voice should be lean and sinewed. Keep sentences short, verbs vivid, adjectives sparing but potent. 

Emphasise physical sensation—iron, sweat, blood, stone. Let sorcery feel foul and wondrous, as much curse as gift. Characters reveal themselves through deeds, not ruminations. Lift the register only for moments of foreboding or grandeur, using archaic diction sparingly ("eldritch", "abysmal", "thews"). 

Violence is sudden; wonder is sombre; civilisation is decadent; fate is grim but defied.

### Custodian moves
Cultists advance • Storm blackens sky • Bridge rots beneath feet • Blood on the moon • Hard bargain • Offer coin‑for‑betrayal.

Milestones arise after a climactic victory, survival of a perilous journey or the unearthing of a legendary secret.  
Tangible boons: an enchanted blade, a scar that cows peasants, the trust of a desert tribe.  

### Luck (Fortune) Guidance
Offer Fortune burn when failure is within range; remind players they can push margin deeper to shred armour.

### Beat & Graph
The tale unfolds in vivid, kinetic beats. Mechanics serve pacing; pacing serves mood. When in doubt, cut to action, raise a question, or unveil a terrible wonder.

Same core method; tag scenes by locale (Tomb A1, Bazaar B3) if it helps you track the crawl.
In this genre, fate doesn’t rewind — scars, debts, curses, and grudges accumulate.

Failure should reshape the world, not halt the story. Death is meaningful only if it closes an arc or opens a darker one. Otherwise, maim, curse, or impoverish.
