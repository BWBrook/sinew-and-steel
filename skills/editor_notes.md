This document describes the editorial style for new skins or rule changes (“Mentzer-era TSR editor”, but adapted to Sinew & Steel’s modern, lean chassis).

## Editorial North Star

- Teach the game as if the reader has never played Sinew & Steel before (and may not have played an RPG at all), but is intelligent and impatient.
- Every rule must answer: what you do at the table, when you do it, and what changes in the fiction/state.
- Clarity beats vibe; vibe is welcome only when it teaches or motivates play.
- Keep “agent harness” operational guidance out of the rules unless it’s truly part of the game system (we’ll keep the player/GM rules clean).

## Process (How to edit a rules/skin document)

  - 1) Define the job of the document (1 paragraph).
      - Who is it for (players? Custodian? both)?
      - What should the reader be able to do immediately after reading it?
      - What should it not try to cover (and where does that live instead)?
  - 2) Structural pass (information architecture first).
      - Ensure sections appear in the order the reader needs them at the table:
          1. What the game is
          2. What you need to play
          3. What a character is (and the minimum sheet)
          4. What you do in play (conversation loop)
          5. When to roll / how to roll
          6. Consequences (damage, pressure, clocks, etc.)
          7. A tiny worked example
      - If a concept is used before defined, reorder or add a “pre-brief” box.
      - Prefer short sections with strong headings over long walls of prose.
  - 3) Mechanical clarity pass (rules precision).
      - Convert any “implied” rules into explicit statements (without bloating).
      - Standardize terminology (one name per thing; no synonyms).
      - Add “defaults” wherever a reader might hesitate:
          - default build points (standard 6)
          - default pressure clock range
          - default when to roll vs narrate
      - Add “edge-case guardrails” only where ambiguity would cause table fights or agent drift.
  - 4) Teaching pass (examples, vignettes, mini-scripts).
      - Add small BECMI-style teaching devices:
          - a micro-vignette (2–6 lines) showing the conversation loop
          - a worked roll example (numbers shown, success/failure + consequence)
          - a micro combat exchange if combat exists in the doc
          - a tiny character build example if creation is in scope
      - Keep examples short, labeled, and obviously optional — but table-useful.
  - 5) Line edit pass (sentence-level).
      - Shorten sentences; prefer verbs; kill ambiguity.
      - Replace “can/may/should” with clear imperatives where it’s a rule.
      - Remove redundant phrases; tighten adjectives; avoid “rulebook throat-clearing.”
  - 6) Layout + usability pass (TSR editor instincts).
      - Add quick-reference elements:
          - “In one sentence” summaries
          - bullet checklists
          - small tables (e.g., what stats mean)
          - “If you remember nothing else…” callouts
      - Enforce consistent Markdown conventions:
          - consistent heading depths
          - consistent naming of dice/rolls
          - consistent formatting for key terms (e.g., Pressure, Luck, Stamina, build points)
  - 7) Consistency + cross-doc pass (minimal, but important).
      - Confirm the quickstart doesn’t contradict core rules.
      - Ensure it matches current mechanics (notably: Stamina baseline 5 participates in build points; build-point budgets; nudge semantics; etc.).
      - If we reference another document, make the reference specific and minimal (“For X, see Y”).
  - 8) Final “table read” pass (does it run?).
      - Pretend I’m at a table with a new group and only this doc.
      - Ask: where would they pause? what would they argue about?
      - Fix those points, not everything.

## Agent editing practice  

If an agent is the primary editor, follow these guidelines:

  - The agent can change:
      - ordering, headings, and layout
      - unclear phrasing, inconsistent terms, missing defaults
      - examples (including updating the Clanfire example character so it is provably legal under the current creation rules)
  - The agent shouldn't change (without asking):
      - core design intent, tone, setting voice
      - any “dial” choices (unless the doc contradicts itself)
      - large stylistic rewrites that risk turning it into a different book

How to Collaborate with a Human Author Per Document

  - Agent should do one document at a time and deliver:
      - the edited file (patch)
      - a short “editor’s memo” of what changed and why (especially any rule clarifications)
      - a short list of “author decisions” (things I’m not sure about and want you to confirm)
  - The human editor should then a final pass and either:
      - approve as-is, or
      - tweak voice/wording, or
      - tell me to adjust specific parts.
  - Then move to the next document.
